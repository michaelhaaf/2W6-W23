       Cascading StyleSheets: What is the ‘Cascade’ of CSS?
      </div>
      <p>We have yet to learn in concrete detail a very important
      mechanic of CSS: when two styles contradict, how does the browser
      determine which style to apply?</p>
      <p>In this lesson, we will learn how CSS rules cascade – that is,
      how browsers traverse CSS files top-down to determine which rules
      are most specific, and therefore chosen as the winning rules.</p>

<h1 id="lesson-overview">Lesson Overview</h1>
<ul>
<li>Review/reference for important CSS mechanics we have learned so
far</li>
<li>Introduction to CSS Cascade: how browsers <em>resolve</em> the CSS
rules we write for elements in our document.</li>
<li>Introduction to <strong>specificity</strong> and
<strong>inheritance</strong>, the two most important concepts for
determining the result of CSS Cascade.</li>
<li>Introduction to a few more CSS mechanics: variables, scope, and
more.</li>

<h1 id="css-mechanics-review">CSS Mechanics Review</h1>
<p>It is worthwhile to double check that you have understood all of the
CSS mechanics (i.e., the rules for CSS works and why) that we have
learned in this class so far. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Syntax</strong>: What are the <em>three</em> ways to add CSS
styles to an HTML element? What are the basic syntax rules for CSS
rules?</li>
<li><strong>Selectors</strong>: How do we <em>select</em> HTML elements
to apply CSS rules? You should know the differences between
<code>type</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>class</code> selectors.
You should also know the difference between <strong>grouping</strong>,
<strong>chaining</strong>, and <strong>descendent</strong>
<strong>combinations</strong> of selectors.</li>
<li><strong>Properties</strong>: You should know some of the CSS
properties that are common to all elements and are being used in our
class all the time: <code>color</code>, <code>background-color</code>,
<code>font-family</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have assigned a new reading this class where you can review all of
these topics: <a
href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations">The
Odin Project: CSS Foundations</a>.</p>
<p>You can also review exercises from previous weeks, including
particularly the <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">CSS
Diner</a>.</p>
<h1 id="css-cascade">CSS Cascade</h1>
<p><em>This section was adapted directly from the ‘The Cascade of CSS’
section of the <a
href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations">Odin
CSS Foundations</a> article linked above, as well as a more detailed
blog post describing the CSS Cascade directly by Amelia Wattenberger,
which you can find <a
href="https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes we may have rules that conflict with one another, and we
end up with some unexpected results. “But I wanted these paragraphs to
be blue, why are they red like these other paragraphs?!” As frustrating
as this can be, it’s important to understand that CSS doesn’t just do
things against our wishes. <strong>CSS only does what we tell it to
do.</strong> What we need to understand more closely is the
<strong>mechanics</strong> of <strong>how</strong> CSS does what we tell
it, and for that, we need to understand the <strong>CSS
Cascade</strong>.</p>
<p>One exception to the above rule is the <a
href="https://example.org">default styles</a> that are provided by a
browser. These default styles vary from browser to browser, and they are
why some elements create a large “gap” between themselves and other
elements, or why buttons look the way they do, despite us not writing
any CSS rules to style them that way.</p>
<p>So if you are writing CSS, there are three possible reasons for
“unexpected behavior”:</p>
<ul>
<li>A browser default style has not been overwritten by you</li>
<li>You have not understood how a property you have written works</li>
<li>You have not understood how the properties you wrote Cascade</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, the procedure for determining why each CSS rule is applied
to a document is <strong>well-defined</strong> by a procedure known as
the <strong>CSS Cascade</strong>. There are different factors that the
cascade uses to determine this, <strong>three</strong> of which we’ll
cover in this class.</p>
<h2 id="specificity">Specificity</h2>
<p>A CSS declaration that is <strong>more specific</strong> will take
precedence over less specific ones. Inline styles, which we will go over
more in the Adding CSS to HTML section towards the end of the lesson,
have the highest specificity compared to selectors, while each type of
selector has its own specificity level that contributes to how specific
a declaration is. Other selectors contribute to specificity, but we’re
focusing only on the ones mentioned in this lesson:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ID selectors (most specific selector)</li>
<li>Class selectors</li>
<li>Type selectors</li>
</ol>
<p>Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has
multiple, conflicting declarations targeting it, sort of like a
tie-breaker. An ID selector will always beat any number of class
selectors, a class selector will always beat any number of type
selectors, and a type selector will always beat any number of anything
less specific than it. When no declaration has a selector with a higher
specificity, a larger amount of a single selector will beat a smaller
amount of that same selector.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a few quick examples to visualize how
specificity works. Consider the following HTML and CSS code:</p>
<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
<h2 id="rule-order">Rule Order</h2>
<h1 id="other-new-css-mechanics">Other New CSS Mechanics</h1>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
