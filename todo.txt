# Website
   - sidebar dropdown level logic (i.e. only expand when in the section... will be tough)
   - compare tufte.css source with mine
   - learn parcel and package properly, refactor
   - search bar
   - mobile:
    - site navbar font/padding looks terrible
    - Heading wrapping looks terrible
    - course calendar table does not fit

# Course
  - different ways to add color
  - selectors : grouping, chaining
