  In first half of this program, we learned a ton of HTML and CSS. You will continue to learn more about HTML and CSS in this course and in your life -- both are vast subjects.

  For now, let's take a big picture break and return to some of the other technologies used in web development. This week, we are going to master using the browser for web development. We are also going to learn the very basics of Javascript in order to learn how HTML/CSS projects can be given dynamic behavior.

# Browsers

A web browser is an integral part of a web developer's toolkit. Not only does the browser render HTML and CSS, all modern browsers are essentially IDEs that contain a suite of tools for inspecting, modifying, and debugging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

No matter which browser you use, the following tutorial (covered in class on Feb 28) will be useful to you: [Chrome Developer Tools][chrome-devtools].

Due to [circumstances beyond the scope of this course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)), almost all modern browsers are based on Chromium -- unless you use Firefox, the above tutorial will be directly relevant to your browser. Make sure you understand all of the techniques shown here!

If you (like me) use Firefox, I currently do not have a tutorial available for you. You can pay close attention to my demonstrations in class to see where Firefox differs from Chromium-based browsers (the differences, for our purposes, are pretty small).

# Javascript

More notes will appear here soon. For now (Wednesday Mar 1), check out [this Odin Project tutorial][odin-js-1] and [the follow up tutorial][odin-js-2] for the content we will be covering. This is more javascript than you need to know for this course -- we will just be getting a taste. But feel free to explore more if you like!
