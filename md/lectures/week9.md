abstract: |
  We have yet to learn in concrete detail a very important mechanic of CSS: when two styles contradict, how does CSS determine which style is applied?

  In this lesson, we will learn how CSS rules cascade -- that is, how browsers traverse CSS files top-down to determine which rules are most specific, and therefore chosen as the winning rules.
