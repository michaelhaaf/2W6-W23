abstract-title: "Intro to Layouts in CSS: Floats and Flexbox"
abstract: |
  Last week, we learned a large set of CSS properties for applying styles to text, image, and other content elements.

  Now that we have a decent amount of practise selecting and styling CSS elements individually, it's time to learn strategies for styling groups of elements -- that is, controlling the layout of HTML elements using CSS.

  There are many techniques for layout in CSS. We will focus on two this week: Floats and Flexbox.

# Knowledge Check

## Floats

This chapter was our first encounter with realistic web page layouts. We learned how to float divs to the left and right, how to deal with content after a float, and how to combine floats with the auto-margin centering technique from the CSS Box Model chapter. These are the tools we need to create sidebars, grids, an magazine-style layouts.

- What is the default layout behavior for block-level HTML elements?
- What layout control does the `display: float` property give web developers?
- What are the two techniques we have for preventing float elements from overlapping?

## Flexbox

- Whatâ€™s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?
- How do you create a flex item?
