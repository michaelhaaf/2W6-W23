## Week 04 Exercises

The first two sets of [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-css-foundations) exercises. They are great general review of CSS foundations/the box model if you ever feel the need to practise.

The final set of exercises comes from a [MDN Web Docs exercise set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Typesetting_a_homepage). It is comprehensive practise for finding and using external web fonts, as well as perfecting typographic CSS skills.
