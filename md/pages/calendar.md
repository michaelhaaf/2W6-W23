This is the authoritative calendar for content covered in this class. It is live, up-to-date, and retroactively maintained to contain all of the lecture/tuturial/reading/assignment/test material covered in this course. 

You can compare this calendar with the calendar from the [Course Outline](../pages/course-outline.html#tentative-schedule) to see where this course has deviated from the original outline.

**Stay tuned:** Throughout the semester I will update this calendar with each week's resources. I will make corresponding updates on **LEA** so that you continue to get notifications through the regular college channels; however, these links will usually just take you to this page unless I indicate otherwise.
