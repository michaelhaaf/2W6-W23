# Odin Project CSS Exercise Solutions

Adapted for
[420-2W6 Winter 2023: User Interfaces](https://michaelhaaf.github.io/2W6-W23/).

## Notes

- Keep in mind that these solutions are definitely not the only possible
  solutions. If your solution differs wildly, but **still passes the self-check
  criteria**, it's probable fine! Feel free to ask about me about it (or your
  classmates! Feel free to ask things at any time).

- Each README has a "Self Check" list. Use this to make sure you haven't missed
  any important details in your implementation in case you are wondering about a
  difference between your work and the solution.

- Open up your work and the solution in the browser and compare the difference
  in their behavior!

- These solutions put all changes at the _end_ of the CSS file, often by
  duplicating some selectors (e.g. there might be a `body {}` in the given CSS,
  and another `body {}` in the solution). When you are working on an exercise,
  you can add your CSS to existing selectors instead of duplicating them at the
  end of the file -- or you can do both. One best practise is to have _less_
  specific selectors at the top (more reusable components) and _more_ specific
  selectors at the bottom (more particular overrides for styling a certain
  thing).
