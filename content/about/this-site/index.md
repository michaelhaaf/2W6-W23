# About this website

This is the companion website for the 420-2W6 course. In this website, you will find all of the notes, labs, and exercises for the course. **Course content updates, assignments, and announcements will also appear on LEA**; that way, you receive notifications for important updates through the normal college channels.

You can follow along directly with course updates at the [course repository](https://github.com/michaelhaaf/2W6-W23).

## How is this page made?

Since this is a course about designing and creating static websites[^1] with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it is worth pointing out that this entire website is built using (mostly) technologies that we learn in this course.

[^1]: [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page): the opposite of a dynamic website; that is, a website which does depend on server-side programming. Static websites are defined entirely by their content (HTML), their style rules (CSS), and their client-side behavior (JavaScript).

This webpage uses the following technologies:

- Markup: [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
- Style and behavior: [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/) and [JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)
- Lecture/page content: [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- Build: [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [lua](https://www.lua.org/), and [python](https://www.python.org/)
- Deployment: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

This procedure is (hopefully, perhaps in the near future) explained in more detail in the course repository [README](https://www.github.com/michaelhaaf/2W6-W23/blob/main/README.md).

# Acknowledgements

Course content, both for lectures and assignments, has been adapted by me from a variety of sources. This section serves the purpose of both acknowledging these references as well as pointing the way for curious students to begin investigating further into course material than we had time to cover.

If you are looking for more detail, coverage, explanation, or problems to go beyond what is covered in my course, I suggest you start with the resources I used to create the course:

## Previous offerings of this course

- [2W6-W21 as taught by Mauricio Buschinelli](https://maujac.github.io/2W6-UI/#/): Covers very similar material to this course. This is a great reference point for any concept we cover in class. Note: this course covers more material than we do, and not all of the material in this course will be included in ours.

## Primary external resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/): This is the course I used to review (or, for the most part, acquire for the first time) my knowledge of Web Development. Our course is mostly based on content found in the [Foundations curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations), as well as the intermediate/advanced CSS content from the [Full Stack](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) paths. After this course, you will be more than ready to complete these two paths on your own. Some assignments/lectures/exercises our course are adapted directly from here.

- [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): This website doubles as a full course in HTML/CSS/JS as well as a thorough reference point. Look here for tutorials at all levels (beginner to advanced) as well as correct and complete documentation of any HTML/CSS/JS concepts we learn. Some assignments/lectures/exercises in our course are adapted directly from here.

- [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/): This is a self-contained HTML/CSS/JS course with clear explanations and excellent demonstrations. Some assignments/lectures/exercises in our course are adapted directly from here.

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/): I consider this an authoritative and complete reference for a couple core concepts covered in this course. The [Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Complete Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#grid-properties) articles on this website are particularly excellent references.

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): Like the MDN Web Docs, w3schools serves as both an authoritative reference for HTML/CSS/JS and also a self-contained course. I prefer MDN Web Docs, but this is often a more straightforward resource with more concise descriptions and explanations.

## Website design references

It is impossible to list all creative inspirations exhaustively. I would like to emphasize the following:

- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/): Seeing the simple grid layout of the MIT OpenCourseWare websites inspired me to create this website in the first place. The basic layout of my website and theirs is still fundamentally similar.
- [Tufte Pandoc CSS](https://jez.io/tufte-pandoc-css/): Article typography on this website is directly inspired by Tufte CSS. While my approach differs in implementation, this website inspired me to create a similar look-and-feel to my course websites.
- There are more to list, when I have more time to remind myself about the development history of this page.
