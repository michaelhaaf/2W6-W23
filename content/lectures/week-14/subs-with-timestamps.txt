that I can think of and I lay it out in
 

23
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,290
that I can think of and I lay it out in
a linear order so that you can create a

24
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:30,300
a linear order so that you can create a
 

25
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,030
a linear order so that you can create a

want to learn now this year it's I I was
a little more long-winded because I

30
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
a little more long-winded because I
 

31
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,889
a little more long-winded because I
wanted to talk more about things instead

the front end Frameworks these are the
 

37
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,530
the front end Frameworks these are the
back end Frameworks there's so many

38

elaborate more on stuff so it's it's
longer than I had anticipated it's

44
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:53,399
longer than I had anticipated it's

go over a couple things about this video

80
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:34,259
go over a couple things about this video
 

81
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,789
go over a couple things about this video
so one it's not a Trends video I do add

82
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:37,799
so one it's not a Trends video I do add
 

83
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,429
so one it's not a Trends video I do add
in some current trends but it's an

84
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:40,439
in some current trends but it's an
 

85
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,350
in some current trends but it's an
all-around road map starting from the

86
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:42,360
all-around road map starting from the
 

87
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,030
all-around road map starting from the
very beginning even with things like

88
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,040
very beginning even with things like
 

89
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,090
very beginning even with things like
text editors and browsers so it's very

90
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,100
text editors and browsers so it's very
 

91
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,890
text editors and browsers so it's very
beginner friendly I don't assume that

92
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:48,900
beginner friendly I don't assume that

occasionally see something underlined or
in bold and that just means that that's

128

in bold and that just means that that's
 

129
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,550
in bold and that just means that that's
what I personally prefer so don't put

what I personally prefer so don't put
 

131
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,710
what I personally prefer so don't put
too much into that because I'm just one

132

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,330
certain area
so another area of Entrepreneurship is

248

so another area of Entrepreneurship is
creating products such as a SAS or

creating products such as a SAS or
 

251
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,890
creating products such as a SAS or
software as a service and this does take

252
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:00,900
software as a service and this does take
 

253
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,710
software as a service and this does take
a ton of time and effort and money and I

254
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:03,720
a ton of time and effort and money and I
 

255
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,510
a ton of time and effort and money and I
do think it's the riskiest of the three

256
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
do think it's the riskiest of the three
 

257
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,270
do think it's the riskiest of the three
but I I also think if you find success

258
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,280
but I I also think if you find success
 

259
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,670
but I I also think if you find success
it can really pay off even more than

260
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:10,680
it can really pay off even more than
 

261
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,610
it can really pay off even more than
than the other ones here my advice would

262
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620
than the other ones here my advice would
 

263
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,950
than the other ones here my advice would
be to start with this as like a

264
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:15,960
be to start with this as like a
 

265
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,170
be to start with this as like a
secondary goal and then later on if you

266
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,180
secondary goal and then later on if you
 

267
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,930
secondary goal and then later on if you
see the potential you could then you

268
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:20,940
see the potential you could then you
 

269
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,390
see the potential you could then you
know move to It Do It full time I think

270
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:23,400
know move to It Do It full time I think
 

271
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,170

educational content which is what I do
 

273
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,510

also falls into this area because you're

274
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
also falls into this area because you're
 

275
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,730

creating a product
 

277
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,969

so some people learn programming simply

278
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:34,979
so some people learn programming simply
 

279
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,129
so some people learn programming simply
because they have a personal project

280
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:37,139
because they have a personal project
 

281
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,469

goal you may even just start programming

288
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
goal you may even just start programming
 

289
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,850
goal you may even just start programming
as a hobby and then switch to one of the

290

as a hobby and then switch to one of the
 

291
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,969

00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:52,979
other areas later on I also put future
 

293
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,950
other areas later on I also put future
proofing because technology is

as a developer anytime soon but it's a

318
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:21,300
as a developer anytime soon but it's a
 

319
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,150
as a developer anytime soon but it's a
great skill to have

320
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,160
great skill to have
 

321
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,909
great skill to have
okay so continuing on with goals you

322
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
okay so continuing on with goals you
 

323
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,409
okay so continuing on with goals you
should decide which type of web

324
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:27,419
should decide which type of web
 

325
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,990
should decide which type of web
developer you want to be the three types

326
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
developer you want to be the three types
 

327
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,450
developer you want to be the three types
are front end back end and full stack

328
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,460
are front end back end and full stack
 

329
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,770
are front end back end and full stack
and we're going to be talking about

330
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:33,780
and we're going to be talking about
 

331
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,409
and we're going to be talking about
technologies that all three of these use

332
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:36,419
technologies that all three of these use
 

333
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,330
technologies that all three of these use
and I'm going to do what I did a couple

334
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:38,340
and I'm going to do what I did a couple
 

335
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,330
and I'm going to do what I did a couple
years ago and color code the the topics

336
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:41,340
years ago and color code the the topics
 

337
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,790
years ago and color code the the topics
and the Technologies so we'll have blue

338
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:43,800
and the Technologies so we'll have blue
 

339
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,610
and the Technologies so we'll have blue
for front end red for back end and green

340
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:46,620
for front end red for back end and green
 

341
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,550
for front end red for back end and green
for full stack all right just to just to

342
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:49,560
for full stack all right just to just to
 

343
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,570
for full stack all right just to just to
kind of categorize all of the different

344
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:52,580
kind of categorize all of the different
 

345
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,350
kind of categorize all of the different
Technologies all the different

346
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
Technologies all the different
 

347
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,990
Technologies all the different
Frameworks and languages and so on and

348
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,000
Frameworks and languages and so on and
 

349
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,170
Frameworks and languages and so on and
make it a little easier to to understand

350
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,180
make it a little easier to to understand
 

351
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,150
make it a little easier to to understand
all right so a front-end developer is

352
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
all right so a front-end developer is
 

353
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,950
all right so a front-end developer is
someone that specializes in the

354
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:03,960
someone that specializes in the
 

355
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,189
someone that specializes in the
user-facing aspect of web development so

356
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
user-facing aspect of web development so
 

357
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,770
user-facing aspect of web development so
the technologies that I put here are

358
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:09,780
the technologies that I put here are
 

359
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,710
the technologies that I put here are
examples of what you may use as that

360
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
examples of what you may use as that
 

361
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,390
examples of what you may use as that
type and you definitely don't need to

362
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
type and you definitely don't need to
 

363
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,550
type and you definitely don't need to
know every single thing I put in these

364
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
know every single thing I put in these
 

365
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,490
know every single thing I put in these
columns also I'm not going to really

366
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:19,500
columns also I'm not going to really
 

367
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,110
columns also I'm not going to really
explain them right now we're going to

368
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
explain them right now we're going to
 

369
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,450
explain them right now we're going to
talk about them throughout the span of

370
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,460
talk about them throughout the span of
 

371
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,370
talk about them throughout the span of
this video but you'll need to know of

372
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:25,380
this video but you'll need to know of
 

373
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,890
this video but you'll need to know of
course HTML and CSS and you'll typically

374
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:27,900
course HTML and CSS and you'll typically
 

375
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,050
course HTML and CSS and you'll typically
need to know how to create Dynamic Pages

376
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,060
need to know how to create Dynamic Pages
 

377
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,330
need to know how to create Dynamic Pages
learn a front-end framework understand

how to consume apis and so on as far as
 

381
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,850
how to consume apis and so on as far as
backend goes you're going to be focusing

382
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:37,860
backend goes you're going to be focusing
 

383
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,370
backend goes you're going to be focusing
on the server side of web development so

384
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,380
on the server side of web development so
 

385
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,450
on the server side of web development so
working with databases servers apis and

386
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:44,460
working with databases servers apis and
 

387
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,969
working with databases servers apis and
back-end developers are responsible for

388
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:46,979
back-end developers are responsible for
 

389
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,550
back-end developers are responsible for
the most of the functionality of a

390
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:49,560
the most of the functionality of a
 

391

website making sure it works correctly
and efficiently they use languages like

394
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,300
and efficiently they use languages like
 

395
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,390
and efficiently they use languages like
JavaScript using node.js PHP Ruby Python

and and just about any other language
 

399
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,950
and and just about any other language
and then databases like MySQL postgres

400
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:05,960
and then databases like MySQL postgres
 

401
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,650

mongodb back-end developers have nothing

402
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:09,660
mongodb back-end developers have nothing
 

403
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,409
mongodb back-end developers have nothing
to do with the the user interface or

407
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,089
what the user sees on a website
then you have a full stack developer

408
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:17,099
then you have a full stack developer
 

409
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,730
then you have a full stack developer
which has a broad range of skills

410
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:19,740
which has a broad range of skills
 

411
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,710
which has a broad range of skills
including both front end and back-end

412
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:21,720
including both front end and back-end
 

413
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,629
including both front end and back-end
development and they have a good

414
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:23,639
development and they have a good
 

415
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,170
development and they have a good
understanding of dynamic interfaces as

Etc and this is a full stack guide which

422
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
Etc and this is a full stack guide which
 

423
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,449
Etc and this is a full stack guide which
includes both front end and back-end

424
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:38,459
includes both front end and back-end
 

425
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,430
includes both front end and back-end
Technologies we're going to start off

426
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:40,440
Technologies we're going to start off
 

427
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,209
Technologies we're going to start off
with the front end and then move to

428
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:43,219
with the front end and then move to
 

429
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,010
with the front end and then move to
back-end languages and so on for the

430
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,020
back-end languages and so on for the
 

431
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,570
back-end languages and so on for the
first half of this guide it's going to

432
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:47,580
first half of this guide it's going to
 

433
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,910
first half of this guide it's going to
be very very JavaScript heavy and the

434
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
be very very JavaScript heavy and the
 

435
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,190
be very very JavaScript heavy and the
reason for that is because JavaScript is

436
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,200
reason for that is because JavaScript is
 

437
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,050
reason for that is because JavaScript is
the language of the front end of the

438
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,060
the language of the front end of the
 

439
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,050
the language of the front end of the
client side so when you get into

440
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,060
client side so when you get into
 

441
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,210
client side so when you get into
server-side development you can use

442
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,220
server-side development you can use
 

443
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,490
server-side development you can use
almost any programming language because

444
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:01,500
almost any programming language because
 

445
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,009
almost any programming language because
that stuff isn't running in the browser

446
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:04,019
that stuff isn't running in the browser
 

447
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,630
that stuff isn't running in the browser
or on the client

448
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:05,640
or on the client
 

449
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,730
or on the client
all right so as far as tools and

450
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:07,740
all right so as far as tools and
 

451
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,350
all right so as far as tools and
Technologies we're going to start at the

452
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
Technologies we're going to start at the
 

453
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,329
Technologies we're going to start at the
very beginning here so what are the

454
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:11,339
very beginning here so what are the
 

455
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,250
very beginning here so what are the
highest level basic tools for web

456
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,260
highest level basic tools for web
 

457
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,290
highest level basic tools for web
development so of course you need a

458
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:15,300
development so of course you need a
 

459
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,090
development so of course you need a
computer I mean you can write code on a

460
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,100
computer I mean you can write code on a
 

461
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,530
computer I mean you can write code on a
mobile device but I wouldn't recommend

462
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:18,540
mobile device but I wouldn't recommend
 

463
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,930
mobile device but I wouldn't recommend
it I do get a lot of questions about the

464
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:20,940
it I do get a lot of questions about the
 

465
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,850
it I do get a lot of questions about the
type of system that you need to start

466
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:22,860
type of system that you need to start
 

467
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,070
type of system that you need to start
programming with you actually don't need

468
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,080
programming with you actually don't need
 

469
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,930
programming with you actually don't need
much especially for web development

470
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:26,940
much especially for web development
 

471
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,090
much especially for web development
where you're most likely not running any

472
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,100
where you're most likely not running any
 

473
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,670
where you're most likely not running any
hardcore compilers or working with

474
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
hardcore compilers or working with
 

475
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,650
hardcore compilers or working with

with the Box model which is the concept

792
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:54,899
with the Box model which is the concept
 

793
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,430
with the Box model which is the concept
that every HTML element is considered a

794
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,440
that every HTML element is considered a
 

795
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,250
that every HTML element is considered a
rectangular box that contains content

796
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:01,260
rectangular box that contains content
 

797
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,530
rectangular box that contains content
and this will include the border the

798
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:03,540
and this will include the border the
 

799
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,870
and this will include the border the
padding the margin and so on and

800
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:05,880
padding the margin and so on and
 

801
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,670
padding the margin and so on and
understanding the Box model is essential

802
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
understanding the Box model is essential
 

803
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,250
understanding the Box model is essential
for controlling layout and spacing of

804
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:10,260
for controlling layout and spacing of
 

805
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,889
for controlling layout and spacing of
your elements another important concept

806
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:12,899
your elements another important concept
 

807
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,430
your elements another important concept
to learn is CSS specificity so

808
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:16,440
to learn is CSS specificity so
 

809
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,009
to learn is CSS specificity so
specificity determines which style rules

810
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:19,019
specificity determines which style rules
 

811
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,870
specificity determines which style rules
are applied to an element when there's

812
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
are applied to an element when there's
 

813
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,629
are applied to an element when there's
multiple conflicting Styles and

814
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:23,639
multiple conflicting Styles and
 

815
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,610
multiple conflicting Styles and
specificity is based on the selectors

816
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:25,620
specificity is based on the selectors
 

817
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,129
specificity is based on the selectors
that are used to Target the element each

818
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:28,139
that are used to Target the element each
 

819
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,230
that are used to Target the element each
selector has a specific weight that

820
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
selector has a specific weight that
 

821
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,569
selector has a specific weight that
determines its priority so for example

822
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:32,579
determines its priority so for example
 

823
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,569
determines its priority so for example
if you have an ID selector that has a

824
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:35,579
if you have an ID selector that has a
 

825
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,910
if you have an ID selector that has a
higher weight than a class selector and

826
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
higher weight than a class selector and
 

827
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,650
higher weight than a class selector and
a class selector has a higher weight

828
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:39,660
a class selector has a higher weight
 

829
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,990
a class selector has a higher weight
than just the element selector so you

830
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
than just the element selector so you
 

831
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,970
than just the element selector so you
want to understand that so that you

832
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:43,980
want to understand that so that you
 

833
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,850
want to understand that so that you
don't have a bunch of instances of the

834
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:46,860
don't have a bunch of instances of the
 

835
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,449
don't have a bunch of instances of the
important flag to kind of overwrite

836
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:49,459
important flag to kind of overwrite
 

837
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:53,090
important flag to kind of overwrite
specific specificity of trouble saying

838
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,100
specific specificity of trouble saying
 

839
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,550
specific specificity of trouble saying
that sometimes another thing you want to

840
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:55,560
that sometimes another thing you want to
 

841
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,769
that sometimes another thing you want to
learn is two things that absolutely

842
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:57,779
learn is two things that absolutely
 

843
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,870
learn is two things that absolutely
change the game for CSS and that's

844
00:16:59,870 --> 00:16:59,880
change the game for CSS and that's
 

845
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,250
change the game for CSS and that's
flexbox and CSS grid so these two are

846
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,260
flexbox and CSS grid so these two are
 

847
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,130
flexbox and CSS grid so these two are
they they make CSS easy to create

848
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,140
they they make CSS easy to create
 

849
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,949
they they make CSS easy to create
layouts with and before that we had to

850
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:09,959
layouts with and before that we had to
 

851
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,789
layouts with and before that we had to
use floats and I went a few quite a few

852
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:13,799
use floats and I went a few quite a few
 

853
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,250
use floats and I went a few quite a few
years creating layouts with floats and

854
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:16,260
years creating layouts with floats and
 

855
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,069
years creating layouts with floats and
it was an absolute nightmare so those of

856
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,079
it was an absolute nightmare so those of
 

857
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,870
it was an absolute nightmare so those of
you that are newer to front-end web

858
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
you that are newer to front-end web
 

859
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,669
you that are newer to front-end web
development you really don't know how

860
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:22,679
development you really don't know how
 

861
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,590
development you really don't know how
lucky you have it because flexbox and

862
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:24,600
lucky you have it because flexbox and
 

863
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,510
lucky you have it because flexbox and
CSS grid they might be a little

864
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:26,520
CSS grid they might be a little
 

865
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,030
CSS grid they might be a little
overwhelming at first but they're really

866
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,040
overwhelming at first but they're really
 

867
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,070
overwhelming at first but they're really
easy to work with once you just you get

868
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,080
easy to work with once you just you get
 

869
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,070
easy to work with once you just you get
the general gist of it down so those are

870
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
the general gist of it down so those are
 

871
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,450
the general gist of it down so those are
two things you definitely want to learn

872
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:35,460
two things you definitely want to learn
 

873
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,450
two things you definitely want to learn
pretty quick all right so once you can

874
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,460
pretty quick all right so once you can
 

875
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,730
pretty quick all right so once you can
create layouts for desktops you'll want

876
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:40,740
create layouts for desktops you'll want
 

877
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,590
create layouts for desktops you'll want
to get into Mobile layouts and

other device on tablets you can do that
 

913
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,590
other device on tablets you can do that
through the dev tools and CSS media

mobile devices you could apply a media

924
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
mobile devices you could apply a media
 

925
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,010
mobile devices you could apply a media
query for let's say 600 pixels or less

926
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,020
query for let's say 600 pixels or less
 

927
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,529
query for let's say 600 pixels or less
and media queries may sound overwhelming

928
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:45,539
and media queries may sound overwhelming
 

929
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,270
and media queries may sound overwhelming
but they're actually pretty easy to work

930
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
but they're actually pretty easy to work
 

931
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,430
but they're actually pretty easy to work
with so these are what I would say are

932
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
with so these are what I would say are
 

933
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,909
with so these are what I would say are
they the absolute needed Concepts and

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:52,919
they the absolute needed Concepts and
 

935
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,430
they the absolute needed Concepts and
features to learn with CSS once to get a

939
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,409
grasp on this stuff you can move on to
things like animations and Transitions

940
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:00,419
things like animations and Transitions
 

941
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,710
things like animations and Transitions
and making your your your designs more

and making your your your designs more
more Dynamic and then there's a bunch of

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,890
more Dynamic and then there's a bunch of
new features in CSS or coming to CSS I

967
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,810
to CSS it's moving much quicker than it
used to I mean we went years and years

968
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:35,820
used to I mean we went years and years

with what seemed like nothing being
 

971
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,789
with what seemed like nothing being
added to CSS but now it seems like it's

972
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
added to CSS but now it seems like it's
 

973
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,710
added to CSS but now it seems like it's
starting to pick up again

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
starting to pick up again
 

975
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,310
starting to pick up again
all right so every other year I've put

976
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
all right so every other year I've put
 

977
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,890
all right so every other year I've put
things like SAS and CSS Frameworks

978
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:48,900
things like SAS and CSS Frameworks
 

979
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,169
things like SAS and CSS Frameworks
before JavaScript and after thinking

980
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:51,179
before JavaScript and after thinking
 

981
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,750
before JavaScript and after thinking
about it this year since CSS Frameworks

982
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
about it this year since CSS Frameworks
 

983
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,850
about it this year since CSS Frameworks
are pretty much optional and SAS is

984
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:55,860
are pretty much optional and SAS is
 

985
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,890
are pretty much optional and SAS is
definitely optional I think after

986
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:57,900
definitely optional I think after
 

987
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,289
definitely optional I think after
learning HTML and CSS you should jump

988
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:00,299
learning HTML and CSS you should jump
 

989
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,990
learning HTML and CSS you should jump
right into JavaScript and notice I have

990
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,000
right into JavaScript and notice I have
 

991
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,330
right into JavaScript and notice I have
backend here as well I have the red box

992
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,340
backend here as well I have the red box
 

993
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,130
backend here as well I have the red box
and I would say it's optional for the

994
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,140
and I would say it's optional for the
 

995
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,310
and I would say it's optional for the
back end but if you plan on going into

996
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
back end but if you plan on going into
 

997
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,789
back end but if you plan on going into
PHP or Python and let's say you're going

998
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:13,799
PHP or Python and let's say you're going
 

999
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,549
PHP or Python and let's say you're going
to use like template engines with PHP

1000
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
to use like template engines with PHP
 

1001
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,529
to use like template engines with PHP
blade templates or something like that

1002
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:18,539
blade templates or something like that
 

1003
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,750
blade templates or something like that
that's all well and fine but if you want

1004
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:20,760
that's all well and fine but if you want
 

1005
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,950
that's all well and fine but if you want

aspects of your UI then you're going to

1008
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:26,760
aspects of your UI then you're going to
 

1009
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,330
aspects of your UI then you're going to
have to know some JavaScript if you only

1010
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:29,340
have to know some JavaScript if you only
 

1011
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,850
have to know some JavaScript if you only
plan on building apis and dealing with

1012
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:31,860
plan on building apis and dealing with
 

1013
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,310
plan on building apis and dealing with
Json data and microservices stuff like

1014
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
Json data and microservices stuff like
 

1015
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,110
Json data and microservices stuff like
that then you can probably skip

1016
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,120
that then you can probably skip
 

1017
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,090
that then you can probably skip
JavaScript if you're going right into

1018

some other language I think a lot of

1020
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
some other language I think a lot of
 

1021
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,430
some other language I think a lot of
people jump into front-end frame works

1022
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
people jump into front-end frame works

line by line one after another however
we do have ways to work with and write

1118
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,360
we do have ways to work with and write
 

1119
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,890
we do have ways to work with and write
asynchronous code in JavaScript which is

1120
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:44,900
asynchronous code in JavaScript which is
 

1121
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,750
asynchronous code in JavaScript which is
important especially when you're working

1122
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
important especially when you're working
 

1123
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,690
important especially when you're working
with web applications that rely on HTTP

1124
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:50,700
with web applications that rely on HTTP
 

1125
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,230
with web applications that rely on HTTP
requests to load data and content so you

1126
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
requests to load data and content so you
 

1127
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,669
requests to load data and content so you
want to get familiar with things like

want to get familiar with things like
 

1129
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,730
want to get familiar with things like
callbacks promises if you're going to

which is the format that is used when

1142
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:14,520
which is the format that is used when

sending data between client and server
okay so now we come to some optional

1146
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
okay so now we come to some optional
 

1147
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,850
okay so now we come to some optional
tools that can extend the capabilities

1148
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:22,860
tools that can extend the capabilities
 

1149
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,630
tools that can extend the capabilities
of CSS so SAS stands for a syntactically

1150
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
of CSS so SAS stands for a syntactically
 

1151
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,029
of CSS so SAS stands for a syntactically
awesome style sheets and it's what we

1152
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
awesome style sheets and it's what we
 

1153
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,029
awesome style sheets and it's what we
call a CSS preprocessor so we create

1154
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:32,039
call a CSS preprocessor so we create
 

1155
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,909
call a CSS preprocessor so we create
these files with either a DOT SAS or dot

1156
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:34,919
these files with either a DOT SAS or dot
 

1157
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,690
these files with either a DOT SAS or dot
scss extension and we can write not only

1158
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:38,700
scss extension and we can write not only
 

1159
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,390
scss extension and we can write not only
CSS but added functionality such as

1160
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,400
CSS but added functionality such as
 

1161
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,870
CSS but added functionality such as
nesting variables functions mix-ins some

1162
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
nesting variables functions mix-ins some
 

1163
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,730
nesting variables functions mix-ins some
of these features like variables are

1164
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:46,740
of these features like variables are
 

1165
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,490
of these features like variables are
already in Native CSS however SAS

1166
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:49,500
already in Native CSS however SAS
 

1167
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,490
already in Native CSS however SAS
variables are much more elegant than CSS

1168
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:52,500
variables are much more elegant than CSS
 

1169
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,909
variables are much more elegant than CSS
custom properties at least in my opinion

1170
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:54,919
custom properties at least in my opinion
 

1171
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,730
custom properties at least in my opinion
CSS will also have nesting soon so I

1172
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:58,740
CSS will also have nesting soon so I
 

1173
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,909
CSS will also have nesting soon so I
think the need for SAS is less and and

1174
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
think the need for SAS is less and and
 

1175
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,570
think the need for SAS is less and and
will be less than what it used to be but

1176
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:05,580
will be less than what it used to be but
 

1177
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,549
will be less than what it used to be but
I think it's still worth learning

1178
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:07,559
I think it's still worth learning
 

1179
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,649
I think it's still worth learning
because it's really easy to learn you

1180
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:09,659
because it's really easy to learn you
 

1181
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,390
because it's really easy to learn you
could you could pick it up in like a

1182
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:11,400
could you could pick it up in like a
 

1183
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,630
could you could pick it up in like a
weekend now the browser doesn't read SAS

1184
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
weekend now the browser doesn't read SAS
 

1185
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,789
weekend now the browser doesn't read SAS
files so the way that this works is you

1186
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
files so the way that this works is you
 

1187
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,890
files so the way that this works is you
use something called a SAS compiler

1188
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:18,900
use something called a SAS compiler
 

1189
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,350
use something called a SAS compiler
which will take those files with that

1190
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
which will take those files with that
 

1191
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,810
which will take those files with that
special syntax and compile it into

1192
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:23,820
special syntax and compile it into
 

1193
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,750
special syntax and compile it into
regular CSS and there's all types of

1194
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:26,760
regular CSS and there's all types of
 

1195
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,390
regular CSS and there's all types of
compilers from command line tools to GUI

1196
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:29,400
compilers from command line tools to GUI
 

1197
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,870
compilers from command line tools to GUI
programs there's also compilers that can

1198
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
programs there's also compilers that can
 

1199
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,850
programs there's also compilers that can
integrate right into your tooling if

1200
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:34,860
integrate right into your tooling if
 

1201
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,590
integrate right into your tooling if
you're using something like webpack and

1202
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:36,600
you're using something like webpack and
 

1203
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,990
you're using something like webpack and
we'll talk more about that later so

1204
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,000
we'll talk more about that later so
 

1205
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,850
we'll talk more about that later so
there's also something called post CSS

1206
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:40,860
there's also something called post CSS
 

1207
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,490
there's also something called post CSS
which can do a lot of the same stuff

1208
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:43,500
which can do a lot of the same stuff
 

1209
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,430
which can do a lot of the same stuff
that SAS can do and more it's just

1210
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:46,440
that SAS can do and more it's just
 

1211
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,590
that SAS can do and more it's just
implemented in a different way it's

1212
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:48,600
implemented in a different way it's
 

1213
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,730
implemented in a different way it's
implemented via JavaScript plugins so if

1214
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:52,740
implemented via JavaScript plugins so if
 

1215
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,270
implemented via JavaScript plugins so if
you wanted to like Minify your CSS or

1216
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,280
you wanted to like Minify your CSS or
 

1217
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,549
you wanted to like Minify your CSS or
automatically add prefixes or something

1218
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
automatically add prefixes or something
 

1219
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,950
automatically add prefixes or something
like that you can install those plugins

1220
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
like that you can install those plugins
 

1221
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,130
like that you can install those plugins
so post CSS does have a learning curve

1222
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:04,140
so post CSS does have a learning curve
 

1223
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,190
so post CSS does have a learning curve
and it's usually used in your tooling

1224
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
and it's usually used in your tooling
 

1225
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,750
and it's usually used in your tooling
and environment with something like

1226
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:08,760
and environment with something like
 

1227
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,810
and environment with something like
webpack so I think at this point it

1228
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:11,820
webpack so I think at this point it
 

1229
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,909
webpack so I think at this point it
would be more beneficial to learn SAS

1230
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:13,919
would be more beneficial to learn SAS
 

1231
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,710
would be more beneficial to learn SAS
just because it's really simple to get

1232
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:15,720
just because it's really simple to get
 

1233
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,990
just because it's really simple to get
up and running and again you could just

1234
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
up and running and again you could just
 

1235
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,630
up and running and again you could just
learn it in a weekend it's I would say

1236
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
learn it in a weekend it's I would say
 

1237
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,690
learn it in a weekend it's I would say
it's optional but it can help you out

1238
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:23,700
it's optional but it can help you out
 

1239
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,210
it's optional but it can help you out
so CSS Frameworks are another useful

1240
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:26,220
so CSS Frameworks are another useful
 

1241
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,250
so CSS Frameworks are another useful
tool for front-end and full stack

1242
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:28,260
tool for front-end and full stack
 

1243
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,289
tool for front-end and full stack
developers and again just like I said

1244
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:30,299
developers and again just like I said
 

1245
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,970
developers and again just like I said
with JavaScript you want to make sure

1246
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:31,980
with JavaScript you want to make sure
 

1247
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,669
with JavaScript you want to make sure
you you learn enough CSS before you jump

1248
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:34,679
you you learn enough CSS before you jump
 

1249
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,370
you you learn enough CSS before you jump
into a framework so these can save you a

1250
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:37,380
into a framework so these can save you a
 

1251
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,750
into a framework so these can save you a
lot of time because they come with

1252
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:38,760
lot of time because they come with
 

1253
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,330
lot of time because they come with
pre-existing classes and components that

1254
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,340
pre-existing classes and components that
 

1255
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,130
pre-existing classes and components that
you can use to speed up your development

1256
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,140
you can use to speed up your development
 

1257
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,350
you can use to speed up your development
they're also great for people that

1258
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
they're also great for people that
 

1259
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,850
they're also great for people that
aren't really good with design

1260
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:46,860
aren't really good with design
 

1261
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,610
aren't really good with design
themselves and creating uis and they're

00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:49,620
themselves and creating uis and they're
 

1263
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,010
themselves and creating uis and they're
good for prototyping if you just need a

1264

all right so let's just quickly talk

1400
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:29,220
all right so let's just quickly talk
 

1401
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,669
all right so let's just quickly talk
about design because

1402
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679
about design because
 

1403
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,669
about design because
it depends on what you're doing as if

1404

it depends on what you're doing as if
 

1405
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,950
it depends on what you're doing as if
you need to be good with design or not

1406

you need to be good with design or not
 

1407
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,590
you need to be good with design or not
or understand UI design if you're if

1408
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
or understand UI design if you're if
 

1409

something like that then you're probably

1414
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,020
something like that then you're probably
 

1415
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,070
something like that then you're probably
going to have other departments that do

1416

going to have other departments that do
 

1417

design stuff you should still know some
basic principles I've I've been asked to

1448
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,000
basic principles I've I've been asked to
 

1449
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,330
basic principles I've I've been asked to
review a lot of websites and sometimes

1450
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:29,340
review a lot of websites and sometimes

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,789
it baffles me when people have like
they'll have their elements all squished

1454
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
they'll have their elements all squished
 

1455
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,769
they'll have their elements all squished
together and and they don't realize that

1456
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:36,779
together and and they don't realize that
 

1457
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,269
together and and they don't realize that
just that little bit of margin that

1458
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:38,279
just that little bit of margin that
 

1459
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,310
just that little bit of margin that
little bit of spacing or white space

1460

little bit of spacing or white space
 

1461
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,230
little bit of spacing or white space
would make their site look so much

1462
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
would make their site look so much
 

1463
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,049
would make their site look so much
better or they'll have a big hero image

1464
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:45,059
better or they'll have a big hero image
 

1465
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,930
better or they'll have a big hero image
and the text is unreadable and all they

1466
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:47,940
and the text is unreadable and all they
 

1467
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,230
and the text is unreadable and all they
have to do is put a a an overlay and it

would make it look so much better so
 

1471
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,710
would make it look so much better so
there's just a couple things that I

1472

there's just a couple things that I
 

1473
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,810
there's just a couple things that I
think every front-end developer should

1474
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:56,820
think every front-end developer should
 

1475
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,930

been working with a lot of designers for

1574
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
been working with a lot of designers for
 

1575
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,810
been working with a lot of designers for
things like ebook covers and things for

1576
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:02,820
things like ebook covers and things for
 

1577
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,090
things like ebook covers and things for
the website and a lot of them are using

1578
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,100
the website and a lot of them are using
 

1579
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,490
the website and a lot of them are using
Envision and the documents that they

1580
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,500
Envision and the documents that they
 

1581
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,470
Envision and the documents that they
send me are really really cool so that's

1582
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:09,480
send me are really really cool so that's
 

1583
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,630
send me are really really cool so that's
something to look into and then you also

1584
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:11,640
something to look into and then you also
 

1585
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,210
something to look into and then you also
have wireframing Solutions as well if

1586
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:14,220
have wireframing Solutions as well if
 

1587
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,830
have wireframing Solutions as well if
you don't want to create a whole mock-up

1588
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
you don't want to create a whole mock-up
 

1589
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,350
you don't want to create a whole mock-up
but you just want like a quick layout uh

1590
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:18,360
but you just want like a quick layout uh
 

1591
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,269
but you just want like a quick layout uh
you know an outline of a website

1592
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:20,279
you know an outline of a website
 

1593
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,669
you know an outline of a website
envisions also good for that but there's

1594
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:22,679
envisions also good for that but there's
 

1595
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,470
envisions also good for that but there's
also mock-ups moq UPS Lucid charts which

1596
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:27,480
also mock-ups moq UPS Lucid charts which
 

1597
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,769
also mock-ups moq UPS Lucid charts which
I actually use for diagrams and charts

1598
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:29,779
I actually use for diagrams and charts
 

1599
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,330

Essentials essential tools that you'll

1632
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,200
Essentials essential tools that you'll
 

1633
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,250
Essentials essential tools that you'll
learn along the way that are not going

learn along the way that are not going
to take you as long to learn but they're

1636
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:15,600
to take you as long to learn but they're
 

1637
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,529
to take you as long to learn but they're
still essential so we'll start with Git

1638
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:18,539
still essential so we'll start with Git
 

1639
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,990
still essential so we'll start with Git
and GitHub so Version Control is very

1640
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,000
and GitHub so Version Control is very
 

1641
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,490
and GitHub so Version Control is very
important that's something that you're

important that's something that you're
 

1643
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,870
important that's something that you're
absolutely going to need to know as a

others and much more and there's a few

1652
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:33,299
others and much more and there's a few
 

1653
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,149
others and much more and there's a few
options other than get for Version

1654
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:35,159
options other than get for Version
 

1655
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,090

Control such as subversion but I rarely

1656
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,100
Control such as subversion but I rarely
 

1657
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,149
Control such as subversion but I rarely
see anyone using that anymore so git is

1658
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:41,159
see anyone using that anymore so git is
 

1659
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,269
see anyone using that anymore so git is
by far the most common solution and it

1660
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:44,279
by far the most common solution and it
 

1661
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,250
by far the most common solution and it
can get overwhelming when you get into

1662
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:46,260
can get overwhelming when you get into
 

1663
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,549
can get overwhelming when you get into
the the less common commands but to

1664
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:49,559
the the less common commands but to
 

1665
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,490
the the less common commands but to
start out just learn the basics you know

1666
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:52,500
start out just learn the basics you know
 

1667
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,049
start out just learn the basics you know
add commit push clone and I know that

1668
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:57,059
add commit push clone and I know that
 

1669
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,289
add commit push clone and I know that
there's there's GUI tools for git as

1670
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:00,299
there's there's GUI tools for git as
 

1671
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,250
there's there's GUI tools for git as
well so there's desktop tools there's um

1672
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:03,260
well so there's desktop tools there's um
 

1673
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,409
well so there's desktop tools there's um
vs code has get integrated with it you

1674
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:06,419
vs code has get integrated with it you
 

1675
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,089
vs code has get integrated with it you
can use that as well but I would still

1676
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:08,099
can use that as well but I would still
 

1677
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,250
can use that as well but I would still
suggest learning the basic commands in

1678
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,260
suggest learning the basic commands in
 

1679
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,530
suggest learning the basic commands in
the command line I have a crash course

1680
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:12,540
the command line I have a crash course
 

1681
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,990
the command line I have a crash course
on get and GitHub it's a little bit

1682
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,000
on get and GitHub it's a little bit
 

1683
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,909
on get and GitHub it's a little bit
older but it's all extremely relevant

1684
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:16,919
older but it's all extremely relevant
 

1685
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,849
older but it's all extremely relevant
it's all the same commands and so on so

1686
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:19,859
it's all the same commands and so on so
 

1687
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,470
it's all the same commands and so on so
the browser Dev tools we talked about

1688
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:21,480
the browser Dev tools we talked about

stack developers all modern browsers
 

1695
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,810
stack developers all modern browsers
have them for instance in Chrome you can

1696
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:29,820
have them for instance in Chrome you can
 

1697
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,690
have them for instance in Chrome you can
hit F12 on Windows or command option I

on a Mac and you'll open up the tools

1700
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:35,580
on a Mac and you'll open up the tools
 

1701

it's a tabbed interface that splits up

1702
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:37,919
it's a tabbed interface that splits up
 

1703
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,010
it's a tabbed interface that splits up
into different tasks so you have the

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:40,020
into different tasks so you have the
 

1705
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,649
into different tasks so you have the

it it's just locally on your machine you
have your JavaScript console which is

1712
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:49,800
have your JavaScript console which is
 

1713
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,190
have your JavaScript console which is
important for errors and debugging the

unbelievably useful to see what's going
 

1723
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,570
unbelievably useful to see what's going
on between the client and server and you

next we have npm or the node package
manager and you won't need this at the

stack development but it can be useful

1898
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:47,940
stack development but it can be useful
 

1899
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,089
stack development but it can be useful
for front end as well so if you need to

1900
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:50,099
for front end as well so if you need to
 

1901
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,430
for front end as well so if you need to
see if you need to test the response of

1902
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:52,440
see if you need to test the response of
 

1903
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,010
see if you need to test the response of
a back end or a public API you can use

1904
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,020
a back end or a public API you can use
 

1905
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,530
a back end or a public API you can use
Postman you could also use Curl which is

1906
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:57,540
Postman you could also use Curl which is
 

1907
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,109
Postman you could also use Curl which is
a command line utility to make requests

1908

a command line utility to make requests
 

1909
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,630
a command line utility to make requests
and then to make requests from your code

1910
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:02,640
and then to make requests from your code
 

1911
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,210
and then to make requests from your code
obviously you have the fetch API but you

1912
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,220
obviously you have the fetch API but you
 

1913
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,910
obviously you have the fetch API but you
also have axios which is a library that

1914
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:07,920
also have axios which is a library that
 

1915
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,609
also have axios which is a library that
you can use that I really love I I

1916
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:10,619
you can use that I really love I I
 

1917
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,890
you can use that I really love I I
prefer it over the fetch API I think

1918
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:12,900
prefer it over the fetch API I think
 

1919
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,410
prefer it over the fetch API I think
it's more full featured and it's easier

1920
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:15,420
it's more full featured and it's easier
 

1921
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,870
it's more full featured and it's easier
to work with but it's similar to what

1922
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:17,880
to work with but it's similar to what
 

1923
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,030
to work with but it's similar to what
fetch does all right so there's going to

1924
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,040
fetch does all right so there's going to
 

1925
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,530

taken the World by storm and I think

2008
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:04,920
taken the World by storm and I think
 

2009
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,670
taken the World by storm and I think
it's the first real display of what AI

with all the good stuff that comes with
 

2023
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,050
with all the good stuff that comes with
these tools I do think there are some

2024
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:24,060
these tools I do think there are some
 

2025
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,210
these tools I do think there are some
negatives as well especially for

2026
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:26,220
negatives as well especially for
 

2027
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,670
negatives as well especially for
beginners I think that it may start to

2028
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:28,680
beginners I think that it may start to
 

2029
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,190
beginners I think that it may start to
dumb people down and make them lazier

2030

dumb people down and make them lazier
 

2031
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,770
dumb people down and make them lazier
because they don't have they don't have

2032
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:33,780
because they don't have they don't have
 

2033
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,050
because they don't have they don't have
to do as much work and I'm not saying

2034
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,060
to do as much work and I'm not saying
 

2035
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,569
to do as much work and I'm not saying
this about everyone or even the majority

2036
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:38,579
this about everyone or even the majority
 

2037
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,730
this about everyone or even the majority
but I do think it will cause some people

2038
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:40,740
but I do think it will cause some people
 

2039
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,609
but I do think it will cause some people
to think less and become more dependent

2040
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:43,619
to think less and become more dependent
 

2041
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,990

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,930
on these tools I also think that
we have the issue of a loss in jobs in

2044
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:50,940
we have the issue of a loss in jobs in
 

2045
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,370
we have the issue of a loss in jobs in
the future but I'm not going to really

2046
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:52,380
the future but I'm not going to really
 

2047
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,349
the future but I'm not going to really
speculate on that too much that's that's

2048
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:54,359
speculate on that too much that's that's
 

2049
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,410

you do use these tools just be aware of

2052
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520

2053
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,510
you do use these tools just be aware of
what you're actually learning versus

2054
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:01,520
what you're actually learning versus
 

2055
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,569
what you're actually learning versus
what you're having the tool do for you I

2056
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:05,579
what you're having the tool do for you I
 

2057

what you're having the tool do for you I
think this is going to be a big issue in

think this is going to be a big issue in
the future so if you're a beginner just

2060
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:09,599
the future so if you're a beginner just
 

2061

other projects make pull requests and so
on I think that any Dev job you get is

2366
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,040
on I think that any Dev job you get is
 

2367
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,609
on I think that any Dev job you get is
is going to be using git and if they

2368
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:25,619
is going to be using git and if they
 

2369
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,530
is going to be using git and if they
don't use git they're going to use some

2370
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:27,540
don't use git they're going to use some
 

2371
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,390
don't use git they're going to use some

so now that you have some foundational

2396
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:55,500
so now that you have some foundational
 

2397
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,770
so now that you have some foundational
front-end skills you need to choose your

2398
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:57,780
front-end skills you need to choose your
 

2399
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,349
front-end skills you need to choose your
next PATH so these are the main options

2400
00:49:00,349 --> 00:49:00,359
next PATH so these are the main options
 

2401
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,230
next PATH so these are the main options
that I came up with and of course they

2402
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,240
that I came up with and of course they
 

2403
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,230
that I came up with and of course they
do blend into each other but I tried to

2404
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:06,240
do blend into each other but I tried to
 

2405
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,390
do blend into each other but I tried to
create a few separate categories based

2406
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:08,400
create a few separate categories based
 

2407
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,670
create a few separate categories based
on what you'll be doing I also put the

2408
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:10,680
on what you'll be doing I also put the
 

2409
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,710
on what you'll be doing I also put the
colors for which type of developer would

2410
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:12,720
colors for which type of developer would
 

2411
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,089
colors for which type of developer would
take that route

2412
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:14,099
take that route
 

2413
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:17,329

applications or super Dynamic uis but
 

2439
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,089
applications or super Dynamic uis but
more like brochure type websites you can

2440
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:50,099
more like brochure type websites you can
 

2441
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:52,010
more like brochure type websites you can
add some JavaScript functionality make

2442
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,020
add some JavaScript functionality make
 

2443
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,589

any other server-side language then you
 

2453
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,210
any other server-side language then you
you might want to move to this area next

2454

if you're sticking with JavaScript you

2456
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:10,859
if you're sticking with JavaScript you
 

2457
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:12,650
if you're sticking with JavaScript you
may want to move to node.js at this

2458

may want to move to node.js at this
 

2459
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,990
may want to move to node.js at this
point especially if you plan on being a

2460
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:15,000
point especially if you plan on being a
 

2461
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,569
point especially if you plan on being a
back-end developer and your goal is not

2462
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:17,579
back-end developer and your goal is not
 

2463

so much creating client facing websites

2464
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:21,060
so much creating client facing websites
 

2465
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,750
so much creating client facing websites
and applications but more like apis and

2466
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:23,760
and applications but more like apis and
 

2467
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,790
and applications but more like apis and
microservices in that case there's

2468
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:25,800
microservices in that case there's
 

2469
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,370
microservices in that case there's
really no need to learn react or web

2470
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:28,380
really no need to learn react or web
 

2471
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,589
really no need to learn react or web
design or anything like that so if you

2472
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:30,599
design or anything like that so if you
 

2473
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,089
design or anything like that so if you
want to skip right to the server side

2474
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:32,099
want to skip right to the server side
 

2475
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:35,089
want to skip right to the server side
Tech you could do that now as well now

2476
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:35,099
Tech you could do that now as well now
 

2477
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,670
Tech you could do that now as well now
if your goal is to be either a front-end

2478

create Dynamic interfaces or you do want
 

2483
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,609
create Dynamic interfaces or you do want
to go the web design route but also want

2484
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:46,619
to go the web design route but also want
 

2485
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,349
to go the web design route but also want
to be able to create more intricate

2486
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:48,359
to be able to create more intricate
 

2487
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,530
to be able to create more intricate
interfaces then I would suggest learning

2488
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:51,540
interfaces then I would suggest learning
 

2489
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,569
interfaces then I would suggest learning
more about front-end tooling and moving

2490
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:53,579
more about front-end tooling and moving
 

2491
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:55,430
more about front-end tooling and moving
to front-end Frameworks that's probably

2492
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
to front-end Frameworks that's probably
 

2493
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,170
to front-end Frameworks that's probably
your best bet and that's what we're

2494
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:57,180
your best bet and that's what we're
 

2495
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,849
your best bet and that's what we're
going to talk about in the next slide

00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:00,470
going to talk about in the next slide
because I think that's the most common

2498
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:00,480
because I think that's the most common
 

2499
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,809
because I think that's the most common
Choice the most common path to take from

2500
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:02,819
Choice the most common path to take from
 

2501
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:05,089
Choice the most common path to take from
here it's also what I would recommend to

2502
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:05,099
here it's also what I would recommend to
 

2503
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,829
here it's also what I would recommend to
just about anyone that isn't doing

2504
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:06,839
just about anyone that isn't doing
 

2505
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,109
just about anyone that isn't doing
strictly back end and then the last

2506
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
strictly back end and then the last
 

2507
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,210
strictly back end and then the last
option I came up with is to keep working

2508
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:11,220
option I came up with is to keep working
 

2509
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,490
option I came up with is to keep working
on your JavaScript skills and just your

2510
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:13,500
on your JavaScript skills and just your
 

2511
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,470
on your JavaScript skills and just your
programming fundamentals in general

2512
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:15,480
programming fundamentals in general
 

2513
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,569
programming fundamentals in general
meaning that you don't move to a

2514
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:17,579
meaning that you don't move to a
 

2515
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,030
meaning that you don't move to a
framework yet but you maybe get into

2516
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,040
framework yet but you maybe get into
 

2517
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,609
framework yet but you maybe get into
algorithms and data structures learn

2518
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:22,619
algorithms and data structures learn
 

2519
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:25,270
algorithms and data structures learn
more about design patterns and so on

2520
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
more about design patterns and so on
 

2521
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,190
more about design patterns and so on
websites like code Wars are great when

2522
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:28,200
websites like code Wars are great when
 

2523
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,450
websites like code Wars are great when
you really want to challenge yourself

2524
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:29,460
you really want to challenge yourself
 

2525
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,630
you really want to challenge yourself
and you want to learn just get better at

2526
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:32,640
and you want to learn just get better at
 

2527
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,790
and you want to learn just get better at
problem solving learning high order

2528
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:34,800
problem solving learning high order
 

2529
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,710
problem solving learning high order
array methods and loops and just

2530
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:36,720
array methods and loops and just
 

2531
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,230
array methods and loops and just
becoming a better programmer and Problem

2532
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:39,240
becoming a better programmer and Problem
 

2533
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,630
becoming a better programmer and Problem
Solver in general so this option I think

2534
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:41,640
Solver in general so this option I think
 

2535
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,230
Solver in general so this option I think
is good if you're coding as a hobby it

2536
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:45,240
is good if you're coding as a hobby it
 

2537
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,730
is good if you're coding as a hobby it
may not be the best option if you're

2538
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:46,740
may not be the best option if you're
 

2539
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,770
may not be the best option if you're
trying to get a job or start freelancing

2540
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:48,780
trying to get a job or start freelancing
 

2541
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,230
trying to get a job or start freelancing
quickly because if you want to do that

2542
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:51,240
quickly because if you want to do that
 

2543
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,329
quickly because if you want to do that
you want to get into the Practical

2544
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:53,339
you want to get into the Practical
 

2545
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,549
you want to get into the Practical
technologies that are going to get you

2546
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:55,559
technologies that are going to get you
 

2547
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,130
technologies that are going to get you
to work okay so like I said we're going

2548
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:58,140
to work okay so like I said we're going
 

2549
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,650
to work okay so like I said we're going
to jump into front-end Frameworks and

2550
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:00,660
to jump into front-end Frameworks and
 

2551
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,109
to jump into front-end Frameworks and
tooling now when I say tooling I mean

2552
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:03,119
tooling now when I say tooling I mean
 

2553
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,450
tooling now when I say tooling I mean
tools that help us have a more advanced

2554
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:05,460
tools that help us have a more advanced
 

2555
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,910
tools that help us have a more advanced
front-end development workflow as

2556
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:07,920
front-end development workflow as
 

2557
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,849
front-end development workflow as
opposed to just having a single JS file

2558
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:10,859
opposed to just having a single JS file
 

2559
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,549
opposed to just having a single JS file
included in our HTML where we have all

2560
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:13,559
included in our HTML where we have all
 

2561
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:15,530
included in our HTML where we have all
of our job JavaScript crammed into that

2562
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:15,540
of our job JavaScript crammed into that
 

2563
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,750
of our job JavaScript crammed into that
one file now when you use a framework

2564
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:17,760
one file now when you use a framework
 

2565
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,849
one file now when you use a framework
like react all this stuff is done under

2566
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:19,859
like react all this stuff is done under
 

2567
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:21,890
like react all this stuff is done under
the hood and if you want to jump right

2568
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:21,900
the hood and if you want to jump right
 

2569
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,990
the hood and if you want to jump right
into a framework that's fine that seems

2570
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,000
into a framework that's fine that seems
 

2571
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,910
into a framework that's fine that seems
to be what most people do actually

2572
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:25,920
to be what most people do actually
 

2573
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,490
to be what most people do actually
however if you want to look more into

2574
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:28,500
however if you want to look more into
 

2575
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,650
however if you want to look more into
build tools I think it'll give you a

2576
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:30,660
build tools I think it'll give you a
 

2577
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,569
build tools I think it'll give you a
better overall picture as to what's

2578
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:32,579
better overall picture as to what's
 

2579
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:35,210
better overall picture as to what's
actually happening and how when and how

2580
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:35,220
actually happening and how when and how
 

2581
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,010
actually happening and how when and how
things work under the hood which I'm a

2582
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:37,020
things work under the hood which I'm a
 

2583
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,589
things work under the hood which I'm a
big fan of so to put it in simple terms

2584
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
big fan of so to put it in simple terms
 

2585
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,930
big fan of so to put it in simple terms
our projects can have a bunch of

2586
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:41,940
our projects can have a bunch of
 

2587
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,510
our projects can have a bunch of
JavaScript modules which are just files

2588
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:44,520
JavaScript modules which are just files
 

2589
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,910
JavaScript modules which are just files
that we Import and Export our code from

2590
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:46,920
that we Import and Export our code from
 

2591
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,490
that we Import and Export our code from
and we can also use third-party modules

2592
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:49,500
and we can also use third-party modules
 

2593
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,309
and we can also use third-party modules
using npm and then what these tools do

2594
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:52,319
using npm and then what these tools do
 

2595
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,290
using npm and then what these tools do
is it takes everything all of our

2596
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:54,300
is it takes everything all of our
 

2597
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,710
is it takes everything all of our
modules both custom and npm modules as

2598
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:57,720
modules both custom and npm modules as
 

2599
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,190
modules both custom and npm modules as
well as other files and assets like CSS

2600
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
well as other files and assets like CSS
 

2601
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,430
well as other files and assets like CSS
and SAS files images and so on and it

2602
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:04,440
and SAS files images and so on and it
 

2603
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,970
and SAS files images and so on and it
compiles it all into a single or maybe a

2604
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:07,980
compiles it all into a single or maybe a
 

2605
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,970
compiles it all into a single or maybe a
few bundled files that we then include

2606
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:10,980
few bundled files that we then include
 

2607
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,849
few bundled files that we then include
in our HTML in our script tag all right

2608
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:13,859
in our HTML in our script tag all right
 

2609
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:15,470
in our HTML in our script tag all right
right so you have your development

2610
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:15,480
right so you have your development
 

2611
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,230
right so you have your development
environment and then you compile it down

2612
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:18,240
environment and then you compile it down
 

2613
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,049
environment and then you compile it down
to assets that you have for production

2614
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:21,059
to assets that you have for production
 

2615
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:23,690
to assets that you have for production
all right so to let's take a look at

2616
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:23,700
all right so to let's take a look at
 

2617
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,630
all right so to let's take a look at
some of these tools now I may be a bit

2618
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:26,640
some of these tools now I may be a bit
 

2619
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,030
some of these tools now I may be a bit
old school but I personally still prefer

2620
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
old school but I personally still prefer
 

2621
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,670
old school but I personally still prefer
webpack it's a module bundler that takes

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,349
webpack it's a module bundler that takes
all your files and bundles them together

00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:35,339
it's been around forever it's
 

2627
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:37,670
it's been around forever it's
essentially the initial module bundler

2628
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:37,680
essentially the initial module bundler
 

2629
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,309
essentially the initial module bundler
but it can be a bit difficult when it

2630
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
but it can be a bit difficult when it
 

2631
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,109
but it can be a bit difficult when it
comes to configuration when you're

2632
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:42,119
comes to configuration when you're
 

2633
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,210
comes to configuration when you're
installing different plugins and loaders

2634
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:44,220
installing different plugins and loaders
 

2635
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,970
installing different plugins and loaders
some of the other tools here are newer

2636
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:46,980
some of the other tools here are newer
 

2637
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,390
some of the other tools here are newer
and they require less configuration

2638
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:49,400
and they require less configuration

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,430
webpack 4 and our starting in webpack
for they call it zero config because you

2642
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:55,440
for they call it zero config because you
 

2643
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,250
for they call it zero config because you
don't technically need configuration to

don't technically need configuration to
 

2645
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,130
don't technically need configuration to
use it but once you want to install a

use it but once you want to install a
 

2647
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,130

plug-in or a loader then it can be a
 

2649
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,569
plug-in or a loader then it can be a
little bit difficult especially for

00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,730
little bit difficult especially for
beginners but it is very very full

2652
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:07,740
beginners but it is very very full
 

2653
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,589
beginners but it is very very full
featured and there's a ton of support

2654
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:09,599
featured and there's a ton of support
 

2655
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,049
featured and there's a ton of support
and resources for it so then you have

2656
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:12,059
and resources for it so then you have
 

2657
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:13,790
and resources for it so then you have
parcel which is also a module one

2658
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:13,800
parcel which is also a module one
 

2659
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,250
parcel which is also a module one
bundler it's it's a bit newer it's less

2660
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:16,260
bundler it's it's a bit newer it's less
 

2661
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,890
bundler it's it's a bit newer it's less
bloated and it's more of a no config

2662
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:18,900
bloated and it's more of a no config
 

2663
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,349
bloated and it's more of a no config
solution but it's also not as full

2664
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:21,359
solution but it's also not as full
 

2665
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,329
solution but it's also not as full
featured so of course you have pros and

2666
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:23,339
featured so of course you have pros and
 

2667
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:26,690
featured so of course you have pros and
cons then we have newer tools like Veet

2668
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:26,700
cons then we have newer tools like Veet
 

2669
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,089
cons then we have newer tools like Veet
so Veet is a build tool but it isn't

2670
00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:29,099
so Veet is a build tool but it isn't
 

2671
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,970
so Veet is a build tool but it isn't
technically a module bundler itself it

2672
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:31,980
technically a module bundler itself it
 

2673
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,490
technically a module bundler itself it
leverages es modules in the browser for

2674
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:34,500
leverages es modules in the browser for
 

2675
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,790
leverages es modules in the browser for
development so in turn it's it runs

2676
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:37,800
development so in turn it's it runs
 

2677
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,829
development so in turn it's it runs
faster and when it comes to building

2678
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:39,839
faster and when it comes to building
 

2679
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,930
faster and when it comes to building
your files for production it uses a

2680
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:41,940
your files for production it uses a
 

2681
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,270
your files for production it uses a
module blinds are called rollup now

2682
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:44,280
module blinds are called rollup now
 

2683
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,910
module blinds are called rollup now
snowpack is another newer tool which is

2684
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:46,920
snowpack is another newer tool which is
 

2685
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,490
snowpack is another newer tool which is
a kind of a no bundle solution it's very

2686
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:49,500
a kind of a no bundle solution it's very
 

2687
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,950
a kind of a no bundle solution it's very
similar to Veet it uses es modules in

2688
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:51,960
similar to Veet it uses es modules in
 

2689
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,530
similar to Veet it uses es modules in
the browser and also uses roll up for

2690
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:54,540
the browser and also uses roll up for
 

2691
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,049
the browser and also uses roll up for
building for production I think tools

2692
00:54:57,049 --> 00:54:57,059
building for production I think tools
 

2693
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:58,910
building for production I think tools
like Veet and snowpack are the future

2694
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:58,920
like Veet and snowpack are the future
 

2695
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,130
like Veet and snowpack are the future
when it comes to front-end build tools

2696
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:01,140
when it comes to front-end build tools
 

2697
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,170
when it comes to front-end build tools
they're much faster they're less bloated

2698
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:03,180
they're much faster they're less bloated
 

2699
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,569
they're much faster they're less bloated
than things like parcel or webpack

2700
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:05,579
than things like parcel or webpack
 

2701
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:07,609
than things like parcel or webpack
however porcelain webpack have been

2702
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:07,619
however porcelain webpack have been
 

2703
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,829
however porcelain webpack have been
around longer and do have more support

2704
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839
around longer and do have more support
 

2705
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,990
around longer and do have more support
and resources available

2706
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:12,000
and resources available
 

2707
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,730
and resources available
okay so now we're going to look at front

2708
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:13,740
okay so now we're going to look at front
 

2709
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,549
okay so now we're going to look at front
end Frameworks and these Frameworks use

2710
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
end Frameworks and these Frameworks use
 

2711
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,950
end Frameworks and these Frameworks use
build tools like we just looked at under

2712
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
build tools like we just looked at under
 

2713
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,990
build tools like we just looked at under
the hood so you don't really have to

2714
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:21,000
the hood so you don't really have to
 

2715
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,370
the hood so you don't really have to
deal with them or deal with any

2716
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:22,380
deal with them or deal with any
 

2717
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,710
deal with them or deal with any
configuration you have tools like create

2718
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
configuration you have tools like create
 

2719
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,750
configuration you have tools like create
react app that'll just scaffold up an

2720
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:26,760
react app that'll just scaffold up an
 

2721
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,630
react app that'll just scaffold up an
application for you so it's up to you if

2722
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:29,640
application for you so it's up to you if
 

2723
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,549
application for you so it's up to you if
you want to really learn what's going on

2724
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:31,559
you want to really learn what's going on
 

2725
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,049
you want to really learn what's going on
under the hood at this point or if you

2726
00:55:33,049 --> 00:55:33,059
under the hood at this point or if you
 

2727
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:35,150
under the hood at this point or if you
want to do that later on now all

want to do that later on now all
front-end Frameworks have the concept of

2730
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
front-end Frameworks have the concept of
 

2731
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,549
front-end Frameworks have the concept of
components so everything in your website

2732
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:40,559
components so everything in your website
 

2733
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,549
components so everything in your website
or UI is looked at as a component from

2734
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:43,559
or UI is looked at as a component from
 

2735
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,250
or UI is looked at as a component from
the navigation to the search boxes to

2736
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:46,260
the navigation to the search boxes to
 

2737
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,770
the navigation to the search boxes to
the blog postcards everything is a

2738
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:48,780
the blog postcards everything is a
 

2739
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,809
the blog postcards everything is a
component and you kind of have to get

2740
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:50,819
component and you kind of have to get
 

2741
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,609
component and you kind of have to get
into that frame of mind when you're

2742
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:52,619
into that frame of mind when you're
 

2743
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,410
into that frame of mind when you're
using a front-end framework

2744
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:54,420
using a front-end framework
 

2745
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,750
using a front-end framework
state is another thing that you'll need

2746
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:56,760
state is another thing that you'll need
 

2747
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,730
state is another thing that you'll need
to get comfortable with state is

2748
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:58,740
to get comfortable with state is
 

2749
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,829
to get comfortable with state is
basically just data there's component

2750
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:00,839
basically just data there's component
 

2751
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:02,990
basically just data there's component
level state which is relative to a

2752
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:03,000
level state which is relative to a
 

2753
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,750
level state which is relative to a
specific component in your UI so for

2754
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:05,760
specific component in your UI so for
 

2755
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,430
specific component in your UI so for
instance if you have like a collapsible

2756
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
instance if you have like a collapsible
 

2757
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,670
instance if you have like a collapsible
menu and it let's say it opens and

2758
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,680
menu and it let's say it opens and
 

2759
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,890
menu and it let's say it opens and
closes when you click something that

2760
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:12,900
closes when you click something that
 

2761
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,890
closes when you click something that
would have a piece of state to tell if

2762
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:15,900
would have a piece of state to tell if
 

2763
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,930
would have a piece of state to tell if
it's open or closed so to just most

2764
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:17,940
it's open or closed so to just most
 

2765
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,030
it's open or closed so to just most
likely be a Boolean value so that would

2766
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:20,040
likely be a Boolean value so that would
 

2767
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,950
likely be a Boolean value so that would
be an example of component level State

2768
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:21,960
be an example of component level State
 

2769
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,770
be an example of component level State
then you have Global or app level state

2770
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:24,780
then you have Global or app level state
 

2771
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,530
then you have Global or app level state
which is data that's available to all

2772
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:27,540
which is data that's available to all
 

2773
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,630
which is data that's available to all
components so if you're fetching data

2774
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:29,640
components so if you're fetching data
 

2775
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,430
components so if you're fetching data
from a database like let's say blog

2776
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
from a database like let's say blog
 

2777
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,290
from a database like let's say blog
posts or something you'd probably want

2778
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:33,300
posts or something you'd probably want
 

2779
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,870
posts or something you'd probably want
to have that data available to multiple

2780
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:35,880
to have that data available to multiple
 

2781
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,030
to have that data available to multiple
components so that would be your Global

2782
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:38,040
components so that would be your Global
 

2783
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,890
components so that would be your Global
State and there's different tools you

2784
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:39,900
State and there's different tools you
 

2785
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,710
State and there's different tools you
can use to manage your Global State both

2786
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
can use to manage your Global State both
 

2787
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,990
can use to manage your Global State both
within the framework and also

2788
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:45,000
within the framework and also
 

2789
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,750
within the framework and also
third-party tools all right now these

2790
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
third-party tools all right now these
 

2791
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,569
third-party tools all right now these
Frameworks were initially created to

2792
00:56:50,569 --> 00:56:50,579
Frameworks were initially created to
 

2793
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:53,329
Frameworks were initially created to
build what are called single single page

2794
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:53,339
build what are called single single page
 

2795
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:56,569
build what are called single single page
applications or Spa spas and basically

2796
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:56,579
applications or Spa spas and basically
 

2797
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,549
applications or Spa spas and basically
what that means is there's just a single

2798
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:58,559
what that means is there's just a single
 

2799
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,069
what that means is there's just a single
HTML page that loads the bundled

2800
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:01,079
HTML page that loads the bundled
 

2801
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,710
HTML page that loads the bundled
JavaScript from the framework and then

2802
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:03,720
JavaScript from the framework and then
 

2803
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,450
JavaScript from the framework and then
all the routes everything all the

2804
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:05,460
all the routes everything all the
 

2805
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,030
all the routes everything all the
components all the state is all in the

2806
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:08,040
components all the state is all in the
 

2807
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,730
components all the state is all in the
JavaScript okay so essentially your

2808
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:10,740
JavaScript okay so essentially your
 

2809
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,309
JavaScript okay so essentially your
entire website or your entire user

2810
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:13,319
entire website or your entire user
 

2811
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:15,710
entire website or your entire user
interface comes from the JavaScript and

2812
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:15,720
interface comes from the JavaScript and
 

2813
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,049
interface comes from the JavaScript and
it's just loaded with a single page now

2814
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:18,059
it's just loaded with a single page now
 

2815
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,510
it's just loaded with a single page now
in addition to that in addition to Spas

2816
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:20,520
in addition to that in addition to Spas
 

2817
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,569
in addition to that in addition to Spas
now we can use meta Frameworks or full

2818
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:23,579
now we can use meta Frameworks or full
 

2819
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:26,630
now we can use meta Frameworks or full
stack Frameworks like nextjs which is

2820
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
stack Frameworks like nextjs which is
 

2821
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,510
stack Frameworks like nextjs which is
still react okay next.js uses react but

2822
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:29,520
still react okay next.js uses react but
 

2823
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,849
still react okay next.js uses react but
we can also write code that runs on the

2824
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:31,859
we can also write code that runs on the
 

2825
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:36,230
we can also write code that runs on the
server as well as code that is is run on

2826
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,240
server as well as code that is is run on
 

2827
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,809
server as well as code that is is run on
the client side run the browser and

2828
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:38,819
the client side run the browser and
 

2829
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:41,630
the client side run the browser and
basically all of these Frameworks have a

2830
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:41,640
basically all of these Frameworks have a
 

2831
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,309
basically all of these Frameworks have a
meta framework that you can use with

2832
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:43,319
meta framework that you can use with
 

2833
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:44,870
meta framework that you can use with
them and I'm going to get into those

2834
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:44,880
them and I'm going to get into those
 

2835
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,270
them and I'm going to get into those
meta Frameworks later but right now I

2836
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280
meta Frameworks later but right now I
 

2837
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,130
meta Frameworks later but right now I
just want to talk about the the basic

2838
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:49,140
just want to talk about the the basic
 

2839
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,410
just want to talk about the the basic
Frameworks all right so first we have

2840
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:51,420
Frameworks all right so first we have
 

2841
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,290
Frameworks all right so first we have
react which was created in 2013 By

2842
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:54,300
react which was created in 2013 By
 

2843
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,450
react which was created in 2013 By
Facebook and I'd say it's the most

2844
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:56,460
Facebook and I'd say it's the most
 

2845
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,490
Facebook and I'd say it's the most
popular front-end framework it's

2846
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:58,500
popular front-end framework it's
 

2847
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,370
popular front-end framework it's
absolutely everywhere technically react

2848
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:01,380
absolutely everywhere technically react
 

2849
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,970
absolutely everywhere technically react
is it's actually a UI library but it's

2850
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:04,980
is it's actually a UI library but it's
 

2851
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,069
is it's actually a UI library but it's
used in the same way that Frameworks are

2852
00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:07,079
used in the same way that Frameworks are
 

2853
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:08,870
used in the same way that Frameworks are
used the only reason it's not a

2854
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:08,880
used the only reason it's not a
 

2855
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,630
used the only reason it's not a
full-fledged framework is because some

2856
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:11,640
full-fledged framework is because some
 

2857
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,130
full-fledged framework is because some
things or a couple things are missing

2858
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:13,140
things or a couple things are missing
 

2859
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,930
things or a couple things are missing
such as a router you know there's no

2860
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:14,940
such as a router you know there's no
 

2861
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,630
such as a router you know there's no
router in the core react Library however

2862
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:17,640
router in the core react Library however
 

2863
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,809
router in the core react Library however
there is a package called react router

2864
00:58:20,809 --> 00:58:20,819
there is a package called react router
 

2865
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:22,849
there is a package called react router
Dom that we can install and use so

2866
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:22,859
Dom that we can install and use so
 

2867
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:25,430
Dom that we can install and use so
things are just more broken up compared

2868
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:25,440
things are just more broken up compared
 

2869
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,710
things are just more broken up compared
to a more full-fledged framework like

2870
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:27,720
to a more full-fledged framework like
 

2871
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,410
to a more full-fledged framework like
angular now as far as learning curve I

2872
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:30,420
angular now as far as learning curve I
 

2873
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,150
angular now as far as learning curve I
would say react is in is in the middle

2874
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
would say react is in is in the middle
 

2875
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,970
would say react is in is in the middle
it's not the most difficult but I also

2876
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:34,980
it's not the most difficult but I also
 

2877
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,970
it's not the most difficult but I also
wouldn't call it easy I would say react

2878
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:37,980
wouldn't call it easy I would say react
 

2879
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,370
wouldn't call it easy I would say react
is my favorite framework but I do have

2880
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:40,380
is my favorite framework but I do have
 

2881
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,650
is my favorite framework but I do have
some issues with it I think that in many

2882
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:42,660
some issues with it I think that in many
 

2883
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,809
some issues with it I think that in many
cases there's just too many ways to do

2884
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:44,819
cases there's just too many ways to do
 

2885
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:46,970
cases there's just too many ways to do
the same thing so it's not really clear

2886
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:46,980
the same thing so it's not really clear
 

2887
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,069
the same thing so it's not really clear
which path to take I think that's kind

2888
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:49,079
which path to take I think that's kind
 

2889
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:51,230
which path to take I think that's kind
of my biggest beef with it it does get

2890
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:51,240
of my biggest beef with it it does get
 

2891
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,270
of my biggest beef with it it does get
updated quite a bit however the updates

2892
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:53,280
updated quite a bit however the updates
 

2893
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,450
updated quite a bit however the updates
don't seem to have too much of an impact

2894
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:56,460
don't seem to have too much of an impact
 

2895
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,569
don't seem to have too much of an impact
on code from older versions one of the

2896
00:58:59,569 --> 00:58:59,579
on code from older versions one of the
 

2897
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,609
on code from older versions one of the
main reasons to choose react is because

2898
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:01,619
main reasons to choose react is because
 

2899
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:03,890
main reasons to choose react is because
of its popularity you know you have

2900
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:03,900
of its popularity you know you have
 

2901
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,710
of its popularity you know you have
access to a ton of resources and support

2902
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:06,720
access to a ton of resources and support
 

2903
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,690
access to a ton of resources and support
and there's a lot of react jobs

2904
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:08,700
and there's a lot of react jobs
 

2905
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,910
and there's a lot of react jobs
available but there's also a lot of

2906
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:10,920
available but there's also a lot of
 

2907
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,549
available but there's also a lot of
react developers now in addition to the

2908
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:13,559
react developers now in addition to the
 

2909
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:15,950
react developers now in addition to the
framework itself I just listed some

2910
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:15,960
framework itself I just listed some
 

2911
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,410
framework itself I just listed some
things that are really popular in the in

2912
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:18,420
things that are really popular in the in
 

2913
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,450
things that are really popular in the in
the react ecosystem or in these

2914
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:20,460
the react ecosystem or in these
 

2915
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,270
the react ecosystem or in these
Frameworks ecosystems so create react

2916
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
Frameworks ecosystems so create react
 

2917
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,849
Frameworks ecosystems so create react
app is a CLI tool that you can use to

2918
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:25,859
app is a CLI tool that you can use to
 

2919
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:28,849
app is a CLI tool that you can use to
quickly spin up a react application if

2920
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:28,859
quickly spin up a react application if
 

2921
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:31,130
quickly spin up a react application if
you wanted to install react in all its

2922
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:31,140
you wanted to install react in all its
 

2923
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,890
you wanted to install react in all its
dependencies manually using npm and then

2924
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:33,900
dependencies manually using npm and then
 

2925
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,569
dependencies manually using npm and then
use some kind of module blunder like

2926
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:35,579
use some kind of module blunder like
 

2927
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:37,910
use some kind of module blunder like
webpack you could absolutely do that but

2928
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
webpack you could absolutely do that but
 

2929
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,250
webpack you could absolutely do that but
create create react app does it really

2930
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:40,260
create create react app does it really
 

2931
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,250
create create react app does it really
quickly and easily and I do see it

2932
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:43,260
quickly and easily and I do see it
 

2933
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,770
quickly and easily and I do see it
losing popularity because of next JS

2934
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:45,780
losing popularity because of next JS
 

2935
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,410
losing popularity because of next JS
next JS is a is a whole new way to use

2936
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:48,420
next JS is a is a whole new way to use
 

2937
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,750
next JS is a is a whole new way to use
react so a lot of people are using that

2938
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:50,760
react so a lot of people are using that
 

2939
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,690
react so a lot of people are using that
over create react app although I think

2940
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:53,700
over create react app although I think
 

2941
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,190
over create react app although I think
for beginner there is if you're just

2942
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,200
for beginner there is if you're just
 

2943
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,630
for beginner there is if you're just
starting out I wouldn't recommend

2944
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:56,640
starting out I wouldn't recommend
 

2945
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,910
starting out I wouldn't recommend
jumping into next JS it's just too much

2946
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:58,920
jumping into next JS it's just too much
 

2947
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,370
jumping into next JS it's just too much
at once so create react app is perfect

2948
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:01,380
at once so create react app is perfect
 

2949
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,710
at once so create react app is perfect
for beginners to get started with the

2950
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:03,720
for beginners to get started with the
 

2951
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,109
for beginners to get started with the
framework then we have the react router

2952
01:00:06,109 --> 01:00:06,119
framework then we have the react router
 

2953
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:08,150
framework then we have the react router
of course it's not included with the

2954
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160
of course it's not included with the
 

2955
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,849
of course it's not included with the
core Library so we usually install react

2956
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:10,859
core Library so we usually install react
 

2957
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:13,250
core Library so we usually install react
router Dom if you want multiple Pages or

2958
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:13,260
router Dom if you want multiple Pages or
 

2959
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:16,130
router Dom if you want multiple Pages or
multiple routes and then jsx is the

2960
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:16,140
multiple routes and then jsx is the
 

2961
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,170
multiple routes and then jsx is the
JavaScript syntax extension that's what

2962
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:18,180
JavaScript syntax extension that's what
 

2963
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,990
JavaScript syntax extension that's what
react components output so it's

2964
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:21,000
react components output so it's
 

2965
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,390
react components output so it's
essentially HTML from within JavaScript

2966
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:23,400
essentially HTML from within JavaScript
 

2967
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,670
essentially HTML from within JavaScript
which makes it Dynamic so we can include

2968
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:25,680
which makes it Dynamic so we can include
 

2969
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,789
which makes it Dynamic so we can include
variables and expressions and so on then

2970
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
variables and expressions and so on then
 

2971
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,829
variables and expressions and so on then
we have the context API which can be

2972
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:30,839
we have the context API which can be
 

2973
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:34,490
we have the context API which can be
used for managing Global State and then

2974
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:34,500
used for managing Global State and then
 

2975
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,010
used for managing Global State and then
we also have third-party State

2976
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:37,020
we also have third-party State
 

2977
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,650
we also have third-party State
Management Systems like Redux which has

2978
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:39,660
Management Systems like Redux which has
 

2979
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,150
Management Systems like Redux which has
been very popular for a long time

2980
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:41,160
been very popular for a long time
 

2981
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,370
been very popular for a long time
there's the Redux toolkit which makes it

2982
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:43,380
there's the Redux toolkit which makes it
 

2983
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,770
there's the Redux toolkit which makes it
easier to work with and then we also

2984
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:45,780
easier to work with and then we also
 

2985
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,510
easier to work with and then we also
have xstate which I see a lot of people

2986
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
have xstate which I see a lot of people
 

2987
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,329
have xstate which I see a lot of people
using recently and it's a state machine

2988
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:50,339
using recently and it's a state machine
 

2989
01:00:50,339 --> 01:00:52,910
using recently and it's a state machine
I haven't used it myself but I'm going

2990
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:52,920
I haven't used it myself but I'm going
 

2991
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,190
I haven't used it myself but I'm going
to be getting into it soon and then

2992
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,200
to be getting into it soon and then
 

2993
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,950
to be getting into it soon and then
there's also a concept of hooks so react

2994
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:57,960
there's also a concept of hooks so react
 

2995
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,349
there's also a concept of hooks so react
components can be either classes or

2996
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:00,359
components can be either classes or
 

2997
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:03,470
components can be either classes or
functions and for a long time classes

2998
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:03,480
functions and for a long time classes
 

2999
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,750
functions and for a long time classes
were were mostly used because you could

3000
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,760
were were mostly used because you could
 

3001
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,870
were were mostly used because you could
do a lot more from class components but

3002
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:08,880
do a lot more from class components but
 

3003
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,870
do a lot more from class components but
in react 16 hooks were introduced which

3004
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:11,880
in react 16 hooks were introduced which
 

3005
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,150
in react 16 hooks were introduced which
allow your functional components to hook

3006
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
allow your functional components to hook
 

3007
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,609
allow your functional components to hook
into the life cycle and you can manage

3008
01:01:16,609 --> 01:01:16,619
into the life cycle and you can manage
 

3009
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:19,309
into the life cycle and you can manage
State and stuff like that so at these

3010
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:19,319
State and stuff like that so at these
 

3011
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:21,349
State and stuff like that so at these
days you're probably going to be using

3012
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:21,359
days you're probably going to be using
 

3013
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,690
days you're probably going to be using
functional components

3014
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:23,700
functional components
 

3015
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,210
functional components
all right so next we have vue.js and

3016
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:26,220
all right so next we have vue.js and
 

3017
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,430
all right so next we have vue.js and
view has been around I believe since

3018
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:28,440
view has been around I believe since
 

3019
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,789
view has been around I believe since
2014 and it is it's a component-based

3020
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:31,799
2014 and it is it's a component-based
 

3021
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:33,589
2014 and it is it's a component-based
framework so it has a lot of the the

3022
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
framework so it has a lot of the the
 

3023
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,890
framework so it has a lot of the the
same fundamentals that react has I think

3024
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:36,900
same fundamentals that react has I think
 

3025
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,230
same fundamentals that react has I think
it has a much easier learning curve than

3026
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:39,240
it has a much easier learning curve than
 

3027
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,630
it has a much easier learning curve than
react I'd say it's probably the the

3028
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:41,640
react I'd say it's probably the the
 

3029
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,750
react I'd say it's probably the the
easiest framework to learn and one thing

3030
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:44,760
easiest framework to learn and one thing
 

3031
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,490
easiest framework to learn and one thing
I like is that it's not it wasn't

3032
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:46,500
I like is that it's not it wasn't
 

3033
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,190
I like is that it's not it wasn't
created by some big conglomerate like

3034
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:49,200
created by some big conglomerate like
 

3035
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,890
created by some big conglomerate like
react in Facebook or angular and Google

3036
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:51,900
react in Facebook or angular and Google
 

3037
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,309
react in Facebook or angular and Google
it was created by a developer named Evan

3038
01:01:55,309 --> 01:01:55,319
it was created by a developer named Evan
 

3039
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:58,730
it was created by a developer named Evan
you and it has a huge Community around

3040
01:01:58,730 --> 01:01:58,740
you and it has a huge Community around
 

3041
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,530
you and it has a huge Community around
it and just the fact that it wasn't

3042
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:00,540
it and just the fact that it wasn't
 

3043
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,289
it and just the fact that it wasn't
created by a huge company and it's so

3044
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:03,299
created by a huge company and it's so
 

3045
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:05,569
created by a huge company and it's so
popular really says a lot about it and

3046
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:05,579
popular really says a lot about it and
 

3047
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:08,329
popular really says a lot about it and
how good it is I say react is my

3048
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:08,339
how good it is I say react is my
 

3049
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:09,890
how good it is I say react is my
favorite framework because it's the one

3050
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:09,900
favorite framework because it's the one
 

3051
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,170
favorite framework because it's the one
I use the most but if I were to start

3052
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:12,180
I use the most but if I were to start
 

3053
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:15,650
I use the most but if I were to start
over and choose a main framework then I

3054
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:15,660
over and choose a main framework then I
 

3055
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,410
over and choose a main framework then I
I can say that I probably choose view

3056
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:18,420
I can say that I probably choose view
 

3057
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,450
I can say that I probably choose view
but that's just my personal opinion

3058
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:20,460
but that's just my personal opinion
 

3059
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,970
but that's just my personal opinion
don't let that affect you know what you

3060
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:22,980
don't let that affect you know what you
 

3061
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,329
don't let that affect you know what you
think or how how how you choose as far

3062
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:26,339
think or how how how you choose as far
 

3063
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:29,150
think or how how how you choose as far
as the ecosystem view CLI is very

3064
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:29,160
as the ecosystem view CLI is very
 

3065
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,250
as the ecosystem view CLI is very
similar to create react app it's used to

3066
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:31,260
similar to create react app it's used to
 

3067
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,530
similar to create react app it's used to
spin up a boilerplate application

3068
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:33,540
spin up a boilerplate application
 

3069
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,650
spin up a boilerplate application
there's also view UI which you can do

3070
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:36,660
there's also view UI which you can do
 

3071
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,589
there's also view UI which you can do
this from the browser from a GUI rather

3072
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
this from the browser from a GUI rather
 

3073
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,450
this from the browser from a GUI rather
than the command line and then there's

3074
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:41,460
than the command line and then there's
 

3075
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,549
than the command line and then there's
the view router which is obviously used

3076
01:02:43,549 --> 01:02:43,559
the view router which is obviously used
 

3077
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,410
the view router which is obviously used
for routing it deeply integrates with

3078
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:45,420
for routing it deeply integrates with
 

3079
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,750
for routing it deeply integrates with
the framework and then for third-party

3080
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:47,760
the framework and then for third-party
 

3081
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,630
the framework and then for third-party
State Management we used Vue X for a

3082
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,640
State Management we used Vue X for a
 

3083
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,650
State Management we used Vue X for a
long time but now it's it's called pinia

3084
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:53,660
long time but now it's it's called pinia
 

3085
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,450
long time but now it's it's called pinia
which is essentially identical to view

3086
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:56,460
which is essentially identical to view
 

3087
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,789
which is essentially identical to view
X5 so it's a little weird so you have

3088
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799
X5 so it's a little weird so you have
 

3089
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,670
X5 so it's a little weird so you have
view X slash pinia I guess for for

3090
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
view X slash pinia I guess for for
 

3091
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,890
view X slash pinia I guess for for
Global State Management

3092
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:03,900
Global State Management
 

3093
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,750
Global State Management
and then there's there's a couple eight

3094
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:05,760
and then there's there's a couple eight
 

3095
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,450
and then there's there's a couple eight
different apis for the components the

3096
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:08,460
different apis for the components the
 

3097
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,329
different apis for the components the
original options API and then in view

3098
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:11,339
original options API and then in view
 

3099
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:15,230
original options API and then in view
three they have the the composition API

3100
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:15,240
three they have the the composition API
 

3101
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,150
three they have the the composition API
which I think is a little bit more

3102
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:17,160
which I think is a little bit more
 

3103
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,069
which I think is a little bit more
difficult I actually prefer the older

3104
01:03:19,069 --> 01:03:19,079
difficult I actually prefer the older
 

3105
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,690
difficult I actually prefer the older
options API

3106
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:20,700
options API
 

3107
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,030
options API
and then view defy is a UI Library

3108
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:23,040
and then view defy is a UI Library
 

3109
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,250
and then view defy is a UI Library
that's very popular it uses Google's

3110
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:25,260
that's very popular it uses Google's
 

3111
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,370
that's very popular it uses Google's
material design guide and I'll I'm going

3112
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:28,380
material design guide and I'll I'm going
 

3113
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,349
material design guide and I'll I'm going
to talk more about UI libraries or

3114
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:30,359
to talk more about UI libraries or
 

3115
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:32,569
to talk more about UI libraries or
component libraries in a little bit

3116
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:32,579
component libraries in a little bit
 

3117
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:36,470
component libraries in a little bit
and then nuxjs is basically next.js and

3118
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,480
and then nuxjs is basically next.js and
 

3119
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,109
and then nuxjs is basically next.js and
but instead of react it uses View and

3120
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:39,119
but instead of react it uses View and
 

3121
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,789
but instead of react it uses View and
again I'll talk more about that later

3122
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
again I'll talk more about that later
 

3123
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,390
again I'll talk more about that later
and more about static State sorry static

3124
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,400
and more about static State sorry static
 

3125
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,030
and more about static State sorry static
site generators such as grid sum which

3126
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:47,040
site generators such as grid sum which
 

3127
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,849
site generators such as grid sum which
is comparable to Gatsby all right so

3128
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:49,859
is comparable to Gatsby all right so
 

3129
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,289
is comparable to Gatsby all right so
those are just some of the things that

3130
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:51,299
those are just some of the things that
 

3131
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:53,990
those are just some of the things that
you'll find in the view ecosystem okay

3132
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
you'll find in the view ecosystem okay
 

3133
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,849
you'll find in the view ecosystem okay
so next we have angular which has been

3134
01:03:55,849 --> 01:03:55,859
so next we have angular which has been
 

3135
01:03:55,859 --> 01:03:58,250
so next we have angular which has been
around a really long time I think it was

3136
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:58,260
around a really long time I think it was
 

3137
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,750
around a really long time I think it was
one of the first big front-end

3138
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
one of the first big front-end
 

3139
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,250
one of the first big front-end
Frameworks although it was much

3140
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:01,260
Frameworks although it was much
 

3141
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,950
Frameworks although it was much
different back then it was angularjs

3142
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:03,960
different back then it was angularjs
 

3143
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,270
different back then it was angularjs
which is essentially a different

3144
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:05,280
which is essentially a different
 

3145
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,390
which is essentially a different
framework than the angular we know today

3146
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:07,400
framework than the angular we know today
 

3147
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,130
framework than the angular we know today
so I think angular is the toughest to

3148
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:10,140
so I think angular is the toughest to
 

3149
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:13,250
so I think angular is the toughest to
learn unlike react it is a full-fledged

3150
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:13,260
learn unlike react it is a full-fledged
 

3151
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:16,670
learn unlike react it is a full-fledged
framework and has a ton of features and

3152
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:16,680
framework and has a ton of features and
 

3153
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,650
framework and has a ton of features and
a ton of things to learn which makes it

3154
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:18,660
a ton of things to learn which makes it
 

3155
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:22,069
a ton of things to learn which makes it
kind of difficult angular has its own

3156
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:22,079
kind of difficult angular has its own
 

3157
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,010
kind of difficult angular has its own
router its own HTTP client it has

3158
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:25,020
router its own HTTP client it has
 

3159
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,990
router its own HTTP client it has
Services which help you manage State

3160
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:27,000
Services which help you manage State
 

3161
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,630
Services which help you manage State
angular also uses typescript out of the

3162
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:29,640
angular also uses typescript out of the
 

3163
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,609
angular also uses typescript out of the
box so that's something else you have to

3164
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:31,619
box so that's something else you have to
 

3165
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:32,510
box so that's something else you have to
learn

3166
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:32,520
learn
 

3167
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,870
learn
along with everything else I do find

3168
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:35,880
along with everything else I do find
 

3169
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,089
along with everything else I do find
that beginners struggle a lot with the

3170
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:38,099
that beginners struggle a lot with the
 

3171
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:40,549
that beginners struggle a lot with the
terminology angular uses like dependency

3172
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:40,559
terminology angular uses like dependency
 

3173
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,130
terminology angular uses like dependency
injection and stuff like that don't get

3174
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:43,140
injection and stuff like that don't get
 

3175
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,170
injection and stuff like that don't get
me wrong I think angular is a really

3176
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:45,180
me wrong I think angular is a really
 

3177
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,809
me wrong I think angular is a really
powerful framework I just think that it

3178
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:47,819
powerful framework I just think that it
 

3179
01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:50,870
powerful framework I just think that it
can be a lot for a beginner and it's

3180
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:50,880
can be a lot for a beginner and it's
 

3181
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,809
can be a lot for a beginner and it's
used mostly in like the Enterprise world

3182
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:53,819
used mostly in like the Enterprise world
 

3183
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:56,030
used mostly in like the Enterprise world
big business you know really large

3184
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:56,040
big business you know really large
 

3185
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,270
big business you know really large
complex applications where react and

3186
01:04:59,270 --> 01:04:59,280
complex applications where react and
 

3187
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,030
complex applications where react and
view can still be used in in those

3188
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:02,040
view can still be used in in those
 

3189
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,670
view can still be used in in those
environments but they're also used a lot

3190
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:04,680
environments but they're also used a lot
 

3191
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,670
environments but they're also used a lot
in startups as well as personal projects

3192
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
in startups as well as personal projects
 

3193
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,950
in startups as well as personal projects
and then as far as the ecosystem we have

3194
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:09,960
and then as far as the ecosystem we have
 

3195
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,829
and then as far as the ecosystem we have
angular CLI which is similar to again

3196
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:12,839
angular CLI which is similar to again
 

3197
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:16,670
angular CLI which is similar to again
create react app and view CLI typescript

3198
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:16,680
create react app and view CLI typescript
 

3199
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,849
create react app and view CLI typescript
as I mentioned angular uses by default

3200
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:19,859
as I mentioned angular uses by default
 

3201
01:05:19,859 --> 01:05:22,569
as I mentioned angular uses by default
so I'll talk more about typescript soon

3202
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:22,579
so I'll talk more about typescript soon
 

3203
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:26,690
so I'll talk more about typescript soon
ngrx is used to manage State it's a

3204
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:26,700
ngrx is used to manage State it's a
 

3205
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,670
ngrx is used to manage State it's a
third-party State management system that

3206
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:28,680
third-party State management system that
 

3207
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,089
third-party State management system that
was actually inspired by Redux and ngrx

3208
01:05:32,089 --> 01:05:32,099
was actually inspired by Redux and ngrx
 

3209
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,430
was actually inspired by Redux and ngrx
uses some thing called observables which

3210
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:34,440
uses some thing called observables which
 

3211
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,010
uses some thing called observables which
are very common in angular and

3212
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:37,020
are very common in angular and
 

3213
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,049
are very common in angular and
observables are used to work with

3214
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:39,059
observables are used to work with
 

3215
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:42,829
observables are used to work with
asynchronous data or data streams and

3216
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:42,839
asynchronous data or data streams and
 

3217
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,569
asynchronous data or data streams and
it's another aspect of angular that I

3218
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:44,579
it's another aspect of angular that I
 

3219
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:46,250
it's another aspect of angular that I
think makes it a little bit tougher to

3220
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:46,260
think makes it a little bit tougher to
 

3221
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,089
think makes it a little bit tougher to
learn

3222
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:47,099
learn
 

3223
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:50,089
learn
and then for server-side rendering we

3224
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:50,099
and then for server-side rendering we
 

3225
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:52,250
and then for server-side rendering we
have angular Universal which can be

3226
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:52,260
have angular Universal which can be
 

3227
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,690
have angular Universal which can be
comparable to next next JS and nuxjs so

3228
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:56,700
comparable to next next JS and nuxjs so
 

3229
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,789
comparable to next next JS and nuxjs so
if you want to render pages on the

3230
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
if you want to render pages on the
 

3231
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,589
if you want to render pages on the
server you can use that

3232
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:00,599
server you can use that
 

3233
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:02,390
server you can use that
and then you also have of course the dev

3234
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:02,400
and then you also have of course the dev
 

3235
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,930
and then you also have of course the dev
tools for the browser as well as vs code

3236
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:05,940
tools for the browser as well as vs code
 

3237
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,809
tools for the browser as well as vs code
extensions or whatever editor you use

3238
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:08,819
extensions or whatever editor you use
 

3239
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:10,309
extensions or whatever editor you use
okay so the next framework we're going

3240
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
okay so the next framework we're going
 

3241
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,410
okay so the next framework we're going
to look at is svelte which is a newer

3242
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:12,420
to look at is svelte which is a newer
 

3243
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,390
to look at is svelte which is a newer
front-end framework that's gained a lot

3244
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:14,400
front-end framework that's gained a lot
 

3245
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,849
front-end framework that's gained a lot
of popularity in the last couple years

3246
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:16,859
of popularity in the last couple years
 

3247
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:19,309
of popularity in the last couple years
and one of the main selling points is

3248
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:19,319
and one of the main selling points is
 

3249
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:22,130
and one of the main selling points is
its small size and fast performance and

3250
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:22,140
its small size and fast performance and
 

3251
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,569
its small size and fast performance and
with svelte it works a little bit

3252
01:06:23,569 --> 01:06:23,579
with svelte it works a little bit
 

3253
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:25,430
with svelte it works a little bit
different so instead of creating a

3254
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:25,440
different so instead of creating a
 

3255
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,650
different so instead of creating a
virtual Dom or a virtual representation

3256
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:27,660
virtual Dom or a virtual representation
 

3257
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,690
virtual Dom or a virtual representation
of the user interface like something

3258
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:29,700
of the user interface like something
 

3259
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,690
of the user interface like something
like react does it instead compiles the

3260
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:32,700
like react does it instead compiles the
 

3261
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,390
like react does it instead compiles the
code into highly efficient and optimized

3262
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:35,400
code into highly efficient and optimized
 

3263
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,029
code into highly efficient and optimized
vanilla JavaScript so technically it's a

3264
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:38,039
vanilla JavaScript so technically it's a
 

3265
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:40,130
vanilla JavaScript so technically it's a
compiler and not a framework but it's

3266
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:40,140
compiler and not a framework but it's
 

3267
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,990
compiler and not a framework but it's
used in the same way as a framework and

3268
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
used in the same way as a framework and
 

3269
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,970
used in the same way as a framework and
it's a direct competitor to the others

3270
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:43,980
it's a direct competitor to the others
 

3271
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,029
it's a direct competitor to the others
and I think it has one of the easiest

3272
01:06:47,029 --> 01:06:47,039
and I think it has one of the easiest
 

3273
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,970
and I think it has one of the easiest
learning curves because it almost feels

3274
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:49,980
learning curves because it almost feels
 

3275
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:53,150
learning curves because it almost feels
like just vanilla JavaScript and it's

3276
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:53,160
like just vanilla JavaScript and it's
 

3277
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,609
like just vanilla JavaScript and it's
also easy to integrate into other

3278
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:55,619
also easy to integrate into other
 

3279
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:58,010
also easy to integrate into other
JavaScript libraries now when it comes

3280
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:58,020
JavaScript libraries now when it comes
 

3281
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,049
JavaScript libraries now when it comes
to the ecosystem there aren't many

3282
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:00,059
to the ecosystem there aren't many
 

3283
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:03,349
to the ecosystem there aren't many
things that aren't included if you use

3284
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:03,359
things that aren't included if you use
 

3285
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,049
things that aren't included if you use
something called svelt kit so svelt kit

3286
01:07:06,049 --> 01:07:06,059
something called svelt kit so svelt kit
 

3287
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:08,750
something called svelt kit so svelt kit
includes routing State Management

3288
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:08,760
includes routing State Management
 

3289
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,930
includes routing State Management
data fetching it even it even has a

3290
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:11,940
data fetching it even it even has a
 

3291
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,450
data fetching it even it even has a
server-side rendering so I'm a big fan

3292
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:14,460
server-side rendering so I'm a big fan
 

3293
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,329
server-side rendering so I'm a big fan
of svelt because it feels like what an

3294
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:17,339
of svelt because it feels like what an
 

3295
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:19,430
of svelt because it feels like what an
experience of a user interface is

3296
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:19,440
experience of a user interface is
 

3297
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,010
experience of a user interface is
supposed to feel like and there's not

3298
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:22,020
supposed to feel like and there's not
 

3299
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,510
supposed to feel like and there's not
all these different terms and

3300
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
all these different terms and
 

3301
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,809
all these different terms and
limitations like you have with a lot of

3302
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:26,819
limitations like you have with a lot of
 

3303
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:29,029
limitations like you have with a lot of
other Frameworks you define a global

3304
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
other Frameworks you define a global
 

3305
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,549
other Frameworks you define a global
variable like you normally would and

3306
01:07:31,549 --> 01:07:31,559
variable like you normally would and
 

3307
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:33,950
variable like you normally would and
there's no hooks or anything needed it's

3308
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:33,960
there's no hooks or anything needed it's
 

3309
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,630
there's no hooks or anything needed it's
just very simple and that's what I love

3310
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:35,640
just very simple and that's what I love
 

3311
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,029
just very simple and that's what I love
about it unfortunately there's not a ton

3312
01:07:38,029 --> 01:07:38,039
about it unfortunately there's not a ton
 

3313
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:41,510
about it unfortunately there's not a ton
of jobs hiring for svelte so that's kind

3314
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
of jobs hiring for svelte so that's kind
 

3315
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,730
of jobs hiring for svelte so that's kind
of the downside to it but if you're

3316
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:43,740
of the downside to it but if you're
 

3317
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,470
of the downside to it but if you're
building like a personal project or

3318
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:45,480
building like a personal project or
 

3319
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,750
building like a personal project or
something I think sveld is a great

3320
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:47,760
something I think sveld is a great
 

3321
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,809
something I think sveld is a great
option it's spelled with svelt kit and

3322
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:50,819
option it's spelled with svelt kit and
 

3323
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:53,329
option it's spelled with svelt kit and
then you also have Dev tools for the

3324
01:07:53,329 --> 01:07:53,339
then you also have Dev tools for the
 

3325
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:56,029
then you also have Dev tools for the
browser and for your your text editors

3326
01:07:56,029 --> 01:07:56,039
browser and for your your text editors
 

3327
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:58,430
browser and for your your text editors
and so on now we also have a new

3328
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:58,440
and so on now we also have a new
 

3329
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,370
and so on now we also have a new
Contender this year called solidjs and

3330
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:01,380
Contender this year called solidjs and
 

3331
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,710
Contender this year called solidjs and
it's technically called a reactive

3332
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:03,720
it's technically called a reactive
 

3333
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,650
it's technically called a reactive
Library it's very similar to react as it

3334
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:06,660
Library it's very similar to react as it
 

3335
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,170
Library it's very similar to react as it
uses components that return jss X

3336
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:09,180
uses components that return jss X
 

3337
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,289
uses components that return jss X
however solid doesn't use a virtual Dom

3338
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:12,299
however solid doesn't use a virtual Dom
 

3339
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:15,109
however solid doesn't use a virtual Dom
like react does it uses a compiler more

3340
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:15,119
like react does it uses a compiler more
 

3341
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,809
like react does it uses a compiler more
like svelt so another big selling point

3342
01:08:17,809 --> 01:08:17,819
like svelt so another big selling point
 

3343
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:20,749
like svelt so another big selling point
for solid is is how lightweight it is I

3344
01:08:20,749 --> 01:08:20,759
for solid is is how lightweight it is I
 

3345
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:22,849
for solid is is how lightweight it is I
believe the entire framework weighs

3346
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:22,859
believe the entire framework weighs
 

3347
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:26,390
believe the entire framework weighs
about 6.5 kilobytes and has extremely

3348
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:26,400
about 6.5 kilobytes and has extremely
 

3349
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,689
about 6.5 kilobytes and has extremely
fast run Time Performance so solid.js is

3350
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:29,699
fast run Time Performance so solid.js is
 

3351
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:31,610
fast run Time Performance so solid.js is
reactive meaning that it automatically

3352
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:31,620
reactive meaning that it automatically
 

3353
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,189
reactive meaning that it automatically
updates the user interface in real time

3354
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:34,199
updates the user interface in real time
 

3355
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:36,709
updates the user interface in real time
as the state of the application changes

3356
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:36,719
as the state of the application changes
 

3357
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,709
as the state of the application changes
and this makes it easy to build complex

3358
01:08:39,709 --> 01:08:39,719
and this makes it easy to build complex
 

3359
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:42,950
and this makes it easy to build complex
and interactive user interfaces without

3360
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960
and interactive user interfaces without
 

3361
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,669
and interactive user interfaces without
the need for a manual Dom manipulation

3362
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
the need for a manual Dom manipulation
 

3363
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,370
the need for a manual Dom manipulation
or complex data binding so as far as the

3364
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:49,380
or complex data binding so as far as the
 

3365
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,769
or complex data binding so as far as the
ecosystem goes if you go to the website

3366
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:51,779
ecosystem goes if you go to the website
 

3367
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:54,590
ecosystem goes if you go to the website
there's an ecosystem link which will

3368
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:54,600
there's an ecosystem link which will
 

3369
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,990
there's an ecosystem link which will
give you a categorized list of all the

3370
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:57,000
give you a categorized list of all the
 

3371
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,329
give you a categorized list of all the
packages that you can use with solid so

3372
01:08:59,329 --> 01:08:59,339
packages that you can use with solid so
 

3373
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:01,430
packages that you can use with solid so
there's testing packages and build tools

3374
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:01,440
there's testing packages and build tools
 

3375
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,209
there's testing packages and build tools
whole UI is a UI library for a solid

3376
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:05,219
whole UI is a UI library for a solid
 

3377
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:07,849
whole UI is a UI library for a solid
that looks pretty promising there is an

3378
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:07,859
that looks pretty promising there is an
 

3379
01:09:07,859 --> 01:09:11,030
that looks pretty promising there is an
SSR frame more called solid start which

3380
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040
SSR frame more called solid start which
 

3381
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,729
SSR frame more called solid start which
looks really cool it actually looks a

3382
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:13,739
looks really cool it actually looks a
 

3383
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:16,249
looks really cool it actually looks a
lot like svelt kit but for a solid.js

3384
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:16,259
lot like svelt kit but for a solid.js
 

3385
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:18,050
lot like svelt kit but for a solid.js
but as far as I can tell it's still in

3386
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:18,060
but as far as I can tell it's still in
 

3387
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,169
but as far as I can tell it's still in
beta so definitely something to to keep

3388
01:09:21,169 --> 01:09:21,179
beta so definitely something to to keep
 

3389
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:22,370
beta so definitely something to to keep
your eye on

3390
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:22,380
your eye on
 

3391
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,530
your eye on
all right so those are the main

3392
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:24,540
all right so those are the main
 

3393
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,749
all right so those are the main
front-end Frameworks that you have to

3394
01:09:26,749 --> 01:09:26,759
front-end Frameworks that you have to
 

3395
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:28,789
front-end Frameworks that you have to
choose from I know that that's a lot of

3396
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
choose from I know that that's a lot of
 

3397
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,010
choose from I know that that's a lot of
information to take in but what I would

3398
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:31,020
information to take in but what I would
 

3399
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,829
information to take in but what I would
suggest is just messing around with a

3400
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:33,839
suggest is just messing around with a
 

3401
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,990
suggest is just messing around with a
couple of them and just seeing what

3402
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000
couple of them and just seeing what
 

3403
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,630
couple of them and just seeing what
feels what feels the best to you what

3404
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:38,640
feels what feels the best to you what
 

3405
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,970
feels what feels the best to you what
feels the most natural and then go off

3406
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:40,980
feels the most natural and then go off
 

3407
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:43,370
feels the most natural and then go off
that you know you don't have to learn

3408
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:43,380
that you know you don't have to learn
 

3409
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,590
that you know you don't have to learn
three different Frameworks in and out

3410
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:45,600
three different Frameworks in and out
 

3411
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,570
three different Frameworks in and out
just try each one that's one of the

3412
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:47,580
just try each one that's one of the
 

3413
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,189
just try each one that's one of the
reasons why I like to create a crash

3414
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
reasons why I like to create a crash
 

3415
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:52,370
reasons why I like to create a crash
course every year every two years on all

3416
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:52,380
course every year every two years on all
 

3417
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:54,830
course every year every two years on all
the Frameworks using or creating the

3418
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:54,840
the Frameworks using or creating the
 

3419
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,689
the Frameworks using or creating the
same application so you can see the

3420
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:56,699
same application so you can see the
 

3421
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:57,830
same application so you can see the
differences

3422
01:09:57,830 --> 01:09:57,840
differences
 

3423
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,689
differences
all right so next we have typescript

3424
01:09:59,689 --> 01:09:59,699
all right so next we have typescript
 

3425
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:01,729
all right so next we have typescript
which is a superset of JavaScript

3426
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:01,739
which is a superset of JavaScript
 

3427
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,410
which is a superset of JavaScript
meaning that it is essentially

3428
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:03,420
meaning that it is essentially
 

3429
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,650
meaning that it is essentially
JavaScript with some added features and

3430
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:06,660
JavaScript with some added features and
 

3431
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,050
JavaScript with some added features and
the main feature of typescript hence the

3432
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:09,060
the main feature of typescript hence the
 

3433
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:12,650
the main feature of typescript hence the
name is static typing so JavaScript the

3434
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:12,660
name is static typing so JavaScript the
 

3435
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:15,110
name is static typing so JavaScript the
JavaScript language is dynamically typed

3436
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,120
JavaScript language is dynamically typed
 

3437
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,390
JavaScript language is dynamically typed
meaning that when we create a variable

3438
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:17,400
meaning that when we create a variable
 

3439
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,970
meaning that when we create a variable
or we add a function parameter we don't

3440
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:19,980
or we add a function parameter we don't
 

3441
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:22,850
or we add a function parameter we don't
specify which type of data that variable

3442
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:22,860
specify which type of data that variable
 

3443
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,250
specify which type of data that variable
should contain so it's Dynamic it

3444
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:25,260
should contain so it's Dynamic it
 

3445
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,169
should contain so it's Dynamic it
happens automatically with many

01:10:27,169 --> 01:10:27,179
happens automatically with many
 

3447
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:29,810
happens automatically with many
languages like Java C sharp C plus plus

3448
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:29,820

3449
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,510
languages like Java C sharp C plus plus
rust and many others you actually have

3450
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:32,520
rust and many others you actually have
 

3451
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,910
rust and many others you actually have
to Define your types for your variables

3452
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:34,920
to Define your types for your variables
 

3453
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,450
to Define your types for your variables
now there are pros and cons to Dynamic

3454
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:38,460
now there are pros and cons to Dynamic
 

3455
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,030
now there are pros and cons to Dynamic
versus static typing a dynamic language

3456
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:41,040
versus static typing a dynamic language
 

3457
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,130
versus static typing a dynamic language
is good in terms of allowing you to

3458
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:43,140
is good in terms of allowing you to
 

3459
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:46,130
is good in terms of allowing you to
write less code which makes you your

3460
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:46,140
write less code which makes you your
 

3461
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,229
write less code which makes you your
right time faster however there are

3462
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:48,239
right time faster however there are
 

3463
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,450
right time faster however there are
advantages to having to declare your

3464
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:50,460
advantages to having to declare your
 

3465
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,330
advantages to having to declare your
types for example static typing can help

3466
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:53,340
types for example static typing can help
 

3467
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,850
types for example static typing can help
catch errors early in the development

3468
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:55,860
catch errors early in the development
 

3469
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,330
catch errors early in the development
process which can then save time and

3470
01:10:59,330 --> 01:10:59,340
process which can then save time and
 

3471
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,689
process which can then save time and
improve the overall quality of the code

3472
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:01,699
improve the overall quality of the code
 

3473
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:04,070
improve the overall quality of the code
static typing can also make the code

3474
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
static typing can also make the code
 

3475
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,770
static typing can also make the code
more self-documenting and easier to read

3476
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:06,780
more self-documenting and easier to read
 

3477
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,290
more self-documenting and easier to read
and there are other features that

3478
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:09,300
and there are other features that
 

3479
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,090
and there are other features that
typescript offers as well especially

3480
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:11,100
typescript offers as well especially
 

3481
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,830
typescript offers as well especially
when it comes to object oriented

3482
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:12,840
when it comes to object oriented
 

3483
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,229
when it comes to object oriented
programming you have classes interfaces

3484
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:15,239
programming you have classes interfaces
 

3485
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:17,330
programming you have classes interfaces
inheritance a lot of this stuff is

3486
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:17,340
inheritance a lot of this stuff is
 

3487
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,310
inheritance a lot of this stuff is
already included within JavaScript after

01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:19,320
already included within JavaScript after
 

3489
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,790
already included within JavaScript after
the es2015 update so the main reason you

3490
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,800
the es2015 update so the main reason you
 

3491
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,950
the es2015 update so the main reason you
would use typescript is for static

3492
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
would use typescript is for static
 

3493
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,810
would use typescript is for static
typing and if you ask me I would say

3494
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:26,820
typing and if you ask me I would say
 

3495
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:29,330
typing and if you ask me I would say
learn JavaScript until you feel really

3496
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:29,340
learn JavaScript until you feel really
 

3497
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,910
learn JavaScript until you feel really
comfortable with it and then you can

3498
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:31,920
comfortable with it and then you can
 

3499
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,250
comfortable with it and then you can
literally pick up typescript in like a

3500
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:34,260
literally pick up typescript in like a
 

3501
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,590
literally pick up typescript in like a
weekend at least the basics it can get

3502
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:36,600
weekend at least the basics it can get
 

3503
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,209
weekend at least the basics it can get
tricky when you start using it with

3504
01:11:38,209 --> 01:11:38,219
tricky when you start using it with
 

3505
01:11:38,219 --> 01:11:40,130
tricky when you start using it with
front-end Frameworks or even on the back

3506
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:40,140
front-end Frameworks or even on the back
 

3507
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,410
front-end Frameworks or even on the back
end with node.js but it is a very

3508
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:42,420
end with node.js but it is a very
 

3509
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:45,770
end with node.js but it is a very
valuable skill to learn and it is big in

3510
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:45,780
valuable skill to learn and it is big in
 

3511
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,870
valuable skill to learn and it is big in
the job market as well

3512
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:47,880
the job market as well

01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,870
the job market as well
okay so we discussed CSS Frameworks

3514
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
okay so we discussed CSS Frameworks
 

3515
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,050
okay so we discussed CSS Frameworks
earlier and how they help you create

3516
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:53,060
earlier and how they help you create
 

3517
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:56,870
earlier and how they help you create
interfaces faster or websites faster as

3518
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
interfaces faster or websites faster as
 

3519
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,090
interfaces faster or websites faster as
you have pre predefined classes to work

3520
01:11:59,090 --> 01:11:59,100
you have pre predefined classes to work
 

3521
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,090
you have pre predefined classes to work
with now you can use CSS Frameworks out

3522
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:02,100
with now you can use CSS Frameworks out
 

3523
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,010
with now you can use CSS Frameworks out
of the box with a front-end framework

3524
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:04,020
of the box with a front-end framework
 

3525
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,830
of the box with a front-end framework
like react however there are also what

3526
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:06,840
like react however there are also what
 

3527
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,990
like react however there are also what
are called UI kits or component

3528
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:09,000
are called UI kits or component
 

3529
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,750
are called UI kits or component
libraries and these take it a step

3530
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
libraries and these take it a step
 

3531
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,149
libraries and these take it a step
further and give you actual styled

3532
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:14,159
further and give you actual styled
 

3533
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,910
further and give you actual styled
components so they have their own State

3534
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:16,920
components so they have their own State
 

3535
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,669
components so they have their own State
and their own properties and their you

3536
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
and their own properties and their you
 

3537
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,250
and their own properties and their you
know they have the design the CSS so for

3538
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:22,260
know they have the design the CSS so for
 

3539
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,470
know they have the design the CSS so for
instance if you wanted a bootstrap alert

3540
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:24,480
instance if you wanted a bootstrap alert
 

3541
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,649
instance if you wanted a bootstrap alert
instead of including a class you would

3542
01:12:27,649 --> 01:12:27,659
instead of including a class you would
 

3543
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:30,470
instead of including a class you would
actually import the alert component into

3544
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
actually import the alert component into
 

3545
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,030
actually import the alert component into
your code and then you could use that

3546
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:32,040
your code and then you could use that
 

3547
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,130
your code and then you could use that
and that has its own props in its own

3548
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:34,140
and that has its own props in its own
 

3549
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,770
and that has its own props in its own
State and so on all right so for react

3550
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:36,780
State and so on all right so for react
 

3551
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:39,470
State and so on all right so for react
you have a library called style

3552
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:39,480
you have a library called style
 

3553
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,229
you have a library called style
components which is very popular and it

3554
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
components which is very popular and it
 

3555
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,850
components which is very popular and it
allows you to do just that you create

3556
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:43,860
allows you to do just that you create
 

3557
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,370
allows you to do just that you create
components that are strictly for styling

3558
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:46,380
components that are strictly for styling
 

3559
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,830
components that are strictly for styling
things like cards and alert and so on

3560
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:48,840
things like cards and alert and so on
 

3561
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,050
things like cards and alert and so on
now the thing with style components is

3562
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:51,060
now the thing with style components is
 

3563
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,209
now the thing with style components is
it's up to you to actually style

3564
01:12:53,209 --> 01:12:53,219
it's up to you to actually style
 

3565
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:54,830
it's up to you to actually style
everything it gives you the

3566
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:54,840
everything it gives you the
 

3567
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,590
everything it gives you the
functionality to be able to

3568
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:57,600
functionality to be able to
 

3569
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,010
functionality to be able to
have create card components but you

3570
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:01,020
have create card components but you
 

3571
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,010
have create card components but you
actually add the CSS for that stuff all

3572
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:04,020
actually add the CSS for that stuff all
 

3573
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,229
actually add the CSS for that stuff all
right in addition to to that you have

3574
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:06,239
right in addition to to that you have
 

3575
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:08,510
right in addition to to that you have
other UI libraries that have the

3576
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:08,520
other UI libraries that have the
 

3577
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,850
other UI libraries that have the
predefined Styles so for instance

3578
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:10,860
predefined Styles so for instance
 

3579
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:14,149
predefined Styles so for instance
material UI is a popular UI kit for

3580
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:14,159
material UI is a popular UI kit for
 

3581
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,950
material UI is a popular UI kit for

react and it's based on Google's
 

3583
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,950
react and it's based on Google's
material design so all the components

3584
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
material design so all the components
 

3585
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,070
material design so all the components
have a certain look as far as the the

have a certain look as far as the the
 

3587

have a certain look as far as the the
buttons sliders inputs and all that

01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:25,020
buttons sliders inputs and all that
 

3589
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,890
buttons sliders inputs and all that
stuff chakra UI is another one for react

3590
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:27,900
stuff chakra UI is another one for react
 

3591
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,169

that's pretty simple and modular and it

3592
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:30,179
that's pretty simple and modular and it
 

3593
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:32,510
that's pretty simple and modular and it
doesn't use any specific framework like

3594
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:32,520
doesn't use any specific framework like
 

3595
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,250
doesn't use any specific framework like
bootstrap or anything like that it's

3596
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:34,260
bootstrap or anything like that it's
 

3597
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:36,649
bootstrap or anything like that it's
kind of its own thing but I really like

3598
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:36,659
kind of its own thing but I really like
 

3599
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:40,669
kind of its own thing but I really like
chakra UI and then for bootstrap you

3600
01:13:40,669 --> 01:13:40,679
chakra UI and then for bootstrap you
 

3601
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:42,709
chakra UI and then for bootstrap you
have you have a few different libraries

3602
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
have you have a few different libraries
 

3603
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,649
have you have a few different libraries
I like react bootstrap basically if you

3604
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:45,659
I like react bootstrap basically if you
 

3605
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:47,570
I like react bootstrap basically if you
want to use let's say a bootstrap nav

3606
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:47,580
want to use let's say a bootstrap nav
 

3607
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:50,510
want to use let's say a bootstrap nav
bar you just import that and you can use

3608
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:50,520
bar you just import that and you can use
 

3609
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,669
bar you just import that and you can use
that you can add whatever props and

3610
01:13:52,669 --> 01:13:52,679
that you can add whatever props and
 

3611
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:55,370
that you can add whatever props and
state are available with that component

3612
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:55,380
state are available with that component
 

3613
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,370
state are available with that component
so for view you have beautiful I which I

3614
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:58,380
so for view you have beautiful I which I
 

3615
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,110
so for view you have beautiful I which I
already mentioned that's I would say the

3616
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:00,120
already mentioned that's I would say the
 

3617
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,649
already mentioned that's I would say the
most popular it is based on Google's

3618
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:03,659
most popular it is based on Google's
 

3619
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:06,649
most popular it is based on Google's
material design like material UI if you

3620
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:06,659
material design like material UI if you
 

3621
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:08,570
material design like material UI if you
want to use a bootstrap component

3622
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:08,580
want to use a bootstrap component
 

3623
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,570
want to use a bootstrap component
Library bootstrap view is a good option

3624
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:11,580
Library bootstrap view is a good option
 

3625
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:14,270
Library bootstrap view is a good option
for that and then there's also Quasar

3626
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:14,280
for that and then there's also Quasar

guide
 

3635
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,410
guide
for angular you have angular material

3636
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:24,420
for angular you have angular material
 

3637
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,390
for angular you have angular material
and then if you want to use bootstrap

3638
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,400
and then if you want to use bootstrap
 

3639
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,610
and then if you want to use bootstrap
you have NG bootstrap there's some other

3640
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:28,620
you have NG bootstrap there's some other
 

3641
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:33,709
you have NG bootstrap there's some other
ones as well for svelte there is svelte

3642
01:14:33,709 --> 01:14:33,719
ones as well for svelte there is svelte
 

3643
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,350
ones as well for svelte there is svelte
material UI which is similar to reacts

3644
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:36,360
material UI which is similar to reacts
 

3645
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,270
material UI which is similar to reacts
material UI and then you also have

3646
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:38,280
material UI and then you also have
 

3647
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,630
material UI and then you also have
svelte strap for solid.js I had

3648
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:41,640
svelte strap for solid.js I had
 

3649
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,790
svelte strap for solid.js I had
mentioned there's uh there's a tool

3650
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:43,800
mentioned there's uh there's a tool
 

3651
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,530
mentioned there's uh there's a tool
called hope UI which looks really cool

3652
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:45,540
called hope UI which looks really cool
 

3653
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:48,169
called hope UI which looks really cool
I've never used it but from the look of

3654
01:14:48,169 --> 01:14:48,179
I've never used it but from the look of
 

3655
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:49,850
I've never used it but from the look of
the components it has a really modern

3656
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:49,860
the components it has a really modern
 

3657
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,430
the components it has a really modern
look to it but there's there's so many

3658
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:52,440
look to it but there's there's so many
 

3659
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,610
look to it but there's there's so many
of these in fact the design resources

3660
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:55,620
of these in fact the design resources
 

3661
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:58,729
of these in fact the design resources
for developers GitHub repo has a ton of

3662
01:14:58,729 --> 01:14:58,739
for developers GitHub repo has a ton of
 

3663
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:01,010
for developers GitHub repo has a ton of
these if you want to check that out

3664
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:01,020
these if you want to check that out
 

3665
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,709
these if you want to check that out
okay so learning testing is not

3666
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:03,719
okay so learning testing is not
 

3667
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:05,330
okay so learning testing is not
something that every developer does

3668
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:05,340
something that every developer does
 

3669
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,209
something that every developer does
early on and who am I kidding this is

3670
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:08,219
early on and who am I kidding this is
 

3671
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:10,189
early on and who am I kidding this is
not something that every developer does

3672
01:15:10,189 --> 01:15:10,199
not something that every developer does
 

3673
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,350
not something that every developer does
ever I think that learning how to write

3674
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:12,360
ever I think that learning how to write
 

3675
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,870
ever I think that learning how to write
unit tests can can be very beneficial

3676
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:14,880
unit tests can can be very beneficial
 

3677
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,270
unit tests can can be very beneficial
and if you're working for a company it

3678
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,280
and if you're working for a company it
 

3679
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,649
and if you're working for a company it
may be something that you absolutely

3680
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:18,659
may be something that you absolutely
 

3681
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:21,290
may be something that you absolutely
need to do if your goal is freelancing

3682
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:21,300
need to do if your goal is freelancing
 

3683
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,750
need to do if your goal is freelancing
my opinion is I think you should just

3684
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:23,760
my opinion is I think you should just
 

3685
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,850
my opinion is I think you should just
skip testing because you're usually not

3686
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:25,860
skip testing because you're usually not
 

3687
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,550
skip testing because you're usually not
creating these giant you know Enterprise

3688
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:28,560
creating these giant you know Enterprise
 

3689
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,770
creating these giant you know Enterprise
level applications and that's where I

3690
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:30,780
level applications and that's where I
 

3691
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:33,229
level applications and that's where I
think tests really matter so just to

3692
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:33,239
think tests really matter so just to
 

3693
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:35,270
think tests really matter so just to
look at some of the examples of the

3694
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
look at some of the examples of the
 

3695
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,970
look at some of the examples of the
different types of testing unit testing

3696
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:37,980
different types of testing unit testing
 

3697
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,610
different types of testing unit testing
is I would say the most common in web

3698
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:40,620
is I would say the most common in web
 

3699
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,490
is I would say the most common in web
development so basically you test for

3700
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:43,500
development so basically you test for
 

3701
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,010
development so basically you test for
specific units of code for example a

3702
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:46,020
specific units of code for example a
 

3703
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,410
specific units of code for example a
function and the goal is to ensure that

3704
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:48,420
function and the goal is to ensure that
 

3705
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,270
function and the goal is to ensure that
each piece of code is doing what it's

3706
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:50,280
each piece of code is doing what it's
 

3707
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,490
each piece of code is doing what it's
supposed to do all right you also have

3708
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:52,500
supposed to do all right you also have
 

3709
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,709
supposed to do all right you also have
integration testing which is a type of

3710
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:54,719
integration testing which is a type of
 

3711
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:56,810
integration testing which is a type of
testing that focuses on how different

3712
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:56,820
testing that focuses on how different
 

3713
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,570
testing that focuses on how different
pieces of code work together and then

3714
01:15:59,570 --> 01:15:59,580
pieces of code work together and then
 

3715
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:02,270
pieces of code work together and then
end-to-end testing is to test the entire

3716
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:02,280
end-to-end testing is to test the entire
 

3717
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,310
end-to-end testing is to test the entire
application from the user's perspective

3718
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:04,320
application from the user's perspective
 

3719
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,649
application from the user's perspective
you also have like performance testing

3720
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:06,659
you also have like performance testing
 

3721
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:10,310
you also have like performance testing
where it tests your application under

3722
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:10,320
where it tests your application under
 

3723
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,430
where it tests your application under
CPU load this isn't really common in web

3724
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:13,440
CPU load this isn't really common in web
 

3725
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,709
CPU load this isn't really common in web
development though a lot of Frameworks

3726
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:15,719
development though a lot of Frameworks
 

3727
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:18,229
development though a lot of Frameworks
and languages have testing capabilities

3728
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:18,239
and languages have testing capabilities
 

3729
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,810
and languages have testing capabilities
included but on the right here are just

3730
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:20,820
included but on the right here are just
 

3731
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,209

some popular libraries and Frameworks
 

3733
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:26,330
some popular libraries and Frameworks
for each language so in JavaScript I

3734
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:26,340
for each language so in JavaScript I
 

3735
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,550
for each language so in JavaScript I
usually use jest but you have mocha

Jasmine you have more specific tools
 

3741
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:36,350
Jasmine you have more specific tools
like react testing library for react and

then all these other languages also have
 

3745
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,970
then all these other languages also have
testing tools as well I'm not going to

3746
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:40,980
testing tools as well I'm not going to
 

3747
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,790
testing tools as well I'm not going to
go through every single one okay so as a

3748
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:43,800
go through every single one okay so as a
 

3749
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,990
go through every single one okay so as a
front-end developer you should be

3750
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:45,000
front-end developer you should be
 

3751
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,810
front-end developer you should be
familiar with the common web apis or

3752

familiar with the common web apis or
 

3753
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:51,830
familiar with the common web apis or
browser apis and I mentioned earlier you

3754
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:51,840
browser apis and I mentioned earlier you
 

3755
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,750
browser apis and I mentioned earlier you
should try to get familiar with the

3756
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
should try to get familiar with the
 

3757
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,030
should try to get familiar with the
browser environment and that includes

3758
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:56,040
browser environment and that includes
 

3759
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,310
browser environment and that includes
these apis and there's more than this

3760
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:58,320
these apis and there's more than this
 

3761
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,930
these apis and there's more than this
these are just some of the common ones

3762
01:16:59,930 --> 01:16:59,940
these are just some of the common ones
 

3763
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,689
these are just some of the common ones
so canvas this is useful for things like

3764
01:17:02,689 --> 01:17:02,699
so canvas this is useful for things like
 

3765
01:17:02,699 --> 01:17:04,850
so canvas this is useful for things like
animation Dynamic graphics and

3766
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:04,860
animation Dynamic graphics and
 

3767
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:07,250
animation Dynamic graphics and
visualization it's really common for

3768
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:07,260
visualization it's really common for
 

3769
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,250
visualization it's really common for
HTML5 games if you want to be able to do

3770
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:10,260
HTML5 games if you want to be able to do
 

3771
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,470
HTML5 games if you want to be able to do
some really cool stuff visually then you

3772
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
some really cool stuff visually then you
 

3773
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,810
some really cool stuff visually then you
want to definitely learn the canvas API

3774
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:14,820
want to definitely learn the canvas API
 

3775
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:18,709
want to definitely learn the canvas API
so geolocation will allow you to ask for

3776
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:18,719
so geolocation will allow you to ask for
 

3777
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,930
so geolocation will allow you to ask for
a user's location we've all had that

3778
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:20,940
a user's location we've all had that
 

3779
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:24,470
a user's location we've all had that
pop-up asking for permission this can be

3780
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:24,480
pop-up asking for permission this can be
 

3781
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,410
pop-up asking for permission this can be
very useful for any kind of project that

3782
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:27,420
very useful for any kind of project that
 

3783
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,630
very useful for any kind of project that
requires the user location so you can

3784
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:29,640
requires the user location so you can
 

3785
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,970
requires the user location so you can
get the latitude and longitude if you

3786
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:31,980
get the latitude and longitude if you
 

3787
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,010
get the latitude and longitude if you
need to place it on some kind of map or

3788
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:34,020
need to place it on some kind of map or
 

3789
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,350
need to place it on some kind of map or
get the local weather whatever it may be

3790
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:36,360
get the local weather whatever it may be
 

3791
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,110
get the local weather whatever it may be
so the speech API is one that's really

3792
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:39,120
so the speech API is one that's really
 

3793
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,590
so the speech API is one that's really
blowing up right now due to the AI chat

3794
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:42,600
blowing up right now due to the AI chat
 

3795
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,110
blowing up right now due to the AI chat
bot stuff going on so this API has

3796
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
bot stuff going on so this API has
 

3797
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,570
bot stuff going on so this API has
speech recognition so that we can speak

3798
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:47,580
speech recognition so that we can speak
 

3799
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,490
speech recognition so that we can speak
into a mic and then get this the

3800
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:49,500
into a mic and then get this the
 

3801
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,070
into a mic and then get this the
transcript as well as speech synthesis

3802
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:52,080
transcript as well as speech synthesis
 

3803
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,470
transcript as well as speech synthesis
to make them the machine talk back with

3804
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
to make them the machine talk back with
 

3805
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,930
to make them the machine talk back with
text-to-speech so this is definitely

3806
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:56,940
text-to-speech so this is definitely
 

3807
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,910
text-to-speech so this is definitely
something to get into and honestly it's

3808
01:17:58,910 --> 01:17:58,920
something to get into and honestly it's
 

3809
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:01,550
something to get into and honestly it's
really easy to learn and easy to use is

3810
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:01,560
really easy to learn and easy to use is
 

3811
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,189
really easy to learn and easy to use is
so the audio and video apis are used

3812
01:18:04,189 --> 01:18:04,199
so the audio and video apis are used
 

3813
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:06,649
so the audio and video apis are used
obviously to deal with media whether

3814
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:06,659
obviously to deal with media whether
 

3815
01:18:06,659 --> 01:18:08,689
obviously to deal with media whether
you're creating a custom video player or

you're creating a custom video player or
 

3817
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:10,790
you're creating a custom video player or
music player or adding effects or

01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:10,800
music player or adding effects or
 

3819
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,790
music player or adding effects or
anything like that and then webrtc is

3820
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:13,800
anything like that and then webrtc is
 

3821
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,530
anything like that and then webrtc is
something I'm seeing a lot of lately as

01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:15,540
something I'm seeing a lot of lately as
 

3823
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:18,290
something I'm seeing a lot of lately as
well it allows you to have real-time

3824
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:18,300
well it allows you to have real-time
 

3825
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:22,669
well it allows you to have real-time
communication over video and or audio so

communication over video and or audio so
 

3827
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:24,530
communication over video and or audio so
you can create voice and video chat

3828
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:24,540
you can create voice and video chat
 

3829
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:27,649
you can create voice and video chat

there it's good for things like storing

3844
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:43,380
there it's good for things like storing
 

3845
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,290
there it's good for things like storing
the user's name for a greeting or

something like that and like I said
 

3849
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,970
something like that and like I said
there's a lot of other apis as well but

3850
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:49,980
there's a lot of other apis as well but
 

3851
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,370
there's a lot of other apis as well but

opinion Frameworks like these are really
 

3871
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:14,930
opinion Frameworks like these are really
the future because before we had either

01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:14,940
the future because before we had either
 

3873
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,330
the future because before we had either
just client-side Frameworks like react

3874
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:17,340
just client-side Frameworks like react
 

3875
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,310
just client-side Frameworks like react
or just server-side Frameworks like

3876
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:19,320
or just server-side Frameworks like
 

3877
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,950
or just server-side Frameworks like
Express or laravel now we have the best

3878
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:21,960
Express or laravel now we have the best
 

3879
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,110
Express or laravel now we have the best
of both worlds and of course these do

3880
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:24,120
of both worlds and of course these do
 

3881
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,209
of both worlds and of course these do
have the limitations it's not like

have the limitations it's not like
back-end apis and microservices are

3884
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
back-end apis and microservices are
 

3885
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,970
back-end apis and microservices are
going anywhere anytime soon but there

3886
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:31,980
going anywhere anytime soon but there
 

3887
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,590
going anywhere anytime soon but there
are a lot of benefits when using

are a lot of benefits when using
 

3889
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,229
are a lot of benefits when using
something like next.js so it's better

3890
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
something like next.js so it's better
 

3891
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,630
something like next.js so it's better
for SEO because search engines can see

at this point so next we have Blazer

4062
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:12,540
at this point so next we have Blazer
 

4063
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,390
at this point so next we have Blazer
which this may not be the perfect

4064
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
which this may not be the perfect
 

4065
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,149
which this may not be the perfect
category for it but I think it fits in

4066
01:23:17,149 --> 01:23:17,159
category for it but I think it fits in
 

4067
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,070
category for it but I think it fits in

of course it has server side

4080
01:23:34,189 --> 01:23:34,199
of course it has server side
 

4081

of course it has server side
functionality as well so we haven't

4082
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:36,540

4083
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,870
functionality as well so we haven't
talked about webassembly I will talk

4084
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
talked about webassembly I will talk
 

4085
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,510
talked about webassembly I will talk
more about it later but as a brief

4086
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:41,520
more about it later but as a brief
 

4087
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,850
more about it later but as a brief
explanation in it's a low-level binary

4088
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:43,860
explanation in it's a low-level binary
 

4089

format for executing code in the browser

4090
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:47,340
format for executing code in the browser
 

4091
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,790
format for executing code in the browser
and that's how we're able to use c-sharp

4092
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:49,800
and that's how we're able to use c-sharp
 

4093
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,490
and that's how we're able to use c-sharp
to write client-side applications as

4094
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:52,500
to write client-side applications as
 

4095
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,070
to write client-side applications as
well of course as well as server-side

4096
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:55,080
well of course as well as server-side
 

4097
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,410
well of course as well as server-side
code so JavaScript is the language of

4098
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:57,420
code so JavaScript is the language of
 

4099
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:58,850
code so JavaScript is the language of
the front end but I think in coming

4100
01:23:58,850 --> 01:23:58,860
the front end but I think in coming
 

4101
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:01,970
the front end but I think in coming
years with webassembly that may start to

01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:01,980
years with webassembly that may start to
 

4103
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,250
years with webassembly that may start to
change so if you want to get into C

4104
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:04,260
change so if you want to get into C
 

4105
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,229

01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:06,239
sharp which I'll talk about when we get
 

4107
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,330
sharp which I'll talk about when we get
into server side Blazer is definitely

4108
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:08,340
into server side Blazer is definitely
 

4109
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,209

01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,330
which we'll talk about next and
different data sources what happens is

4206
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:05,340
different data sources what happens is
 

4207
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,550
different data sources what happens is
all the data fetching happens before

4208
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:07,560
all the data fetching happens before
 

4209
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,590
all the data fetching happens before
build time so this makes your site

4210
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
build time so this makes your site
 

4211
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,450
build time so this makes your site
really fast because it doesn't have to

4212
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:11,460
really fast because it doesn't have to
 

4213
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:14,030
really fast because it doesn't have to
go out and fetch data while the user is

4214
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:14,040
go out and fetch data while the user is
 

4215
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,709
go out and fetch data while the user is
using it you know waiting for the data

4216
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:15,719
using it you know waiting for the data
 

4217
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:17,689
using it you know waiting for the data
to be fetched it's already pre-fetched

4218
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:17,699
to be fetched it's already pre-fetched
 

4219
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:21,050
to be fetched it's already pre-fetched
so one thing I want to say is that I

4220
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:21,060
so one thing I want to say is that I
 

4221
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:23,149
so one thing I want to say is that I
think these are great for Freelancers a

4222
01:26:23,149 --> 01:26:23,159
think these are great for Freelancers a
 

4223
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:24,350
think these are great for Freelancers a
lot of the projects we get as

4224
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:24,360
lot of the projects we get as
 

4225
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,850
lot of the projects we get as
Freelancers are things like small

4226
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:25,860
Freelancers are things like small
 

4227
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,129
Freelancers are things like small
business websites and this gives you a

4228
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:28,139
business websites and this gives you a
 

4229
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:30,950
business websites and this gives you a
real modern solution to quickly create

4230
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:30,960
real modern solution to quickly create
 

4231
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,530
real modern solution to quickly create
very performant websites that are search

4232
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:33,540
very performant websites that are search
 

4233
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,990
very performant websites that are search
engine friendly which of course is very

4234
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:36,000
engine friendly which of course is very
 

4235
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,270
engine friendly which of course is very
important to small businesses and

4236
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:38,280
important to small businesses and
 

4237
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,270
important to small businesses and
important in freelancing all right so

4238
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
important in freelancing all right so
 

4239
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,129
important in freelancing all right so
I'm going to start off with my favorite

4240
01:26:43,129 --> 01:26:43,139
I'm going to start off with my favorite
 

4241
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:46,310
I'm going to start off with my favorite
one which is Astro so it's one of those

4242
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:46,320
one which is Astro so it's one of those
 

4243
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,689
one which is Astro so it's one of those
things where

4244
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:47,699
things where
 

4245
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:50,209
things where
it just works how you would expect and

4246
01:26:50,209 --> 01:26:50,219
it just works how you would expect and
 

4247
01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:52,310
it just works how you would expect and
how you would want so you can build your

4248
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,320
how you would want so you can build your
 

4249
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,350
how you would want so you can build your
site using JavaScript components whether

4250
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:54,360
site using JavaScript components whether
 

4251
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:55,970
site using JavaScript components whether
it's Astro components which are

4252
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:55,980
it's Astro components which are
 

4253
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,550
it's Astro components which are
extremely simple or you can use react

4254
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:58,560
extremely simple or you can use react
 

4255
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,129
extremely simple or you can use react
view spelled so you can use these other

4256
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:01,139
view spelled so you can use these other
 

4257
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:03,830
view spelled so you can use these other
Frameworks as well to build these fast

4258
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:03,840
Frameworks as well to build these fast
 

4259
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,470
Frameworks as well to build these fast
performance static sites now once you

4260
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,480
performance static sites now once you
 

4261
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,390
performance static sites now once you
build your site and you have your

4262
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:08,400
build your site and you have your
 

4263
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,550
build your site and you have your
components it actually gets compiled

4264
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
components it actually gets compiled
 

4265
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,550
components it actually gets compiled
into static HTML at build time so it

4266
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:13,560
into static HTML at build time so it
 

4267
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,110
into static HTML at build time so it
strips out all the client-side

4268
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:15,120
strips out all the client-side
 

4269
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,390
strips out all the client-side
JavaScript that you use to create your

4270
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:17,400
JavaScript that you use to create your
 

4271
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,930
JavaScript that you use to create your
components and so on so it it utilizes

4272
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:20,940
components and so on so it it utilizes
 

4273
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:23,270
components and so on so it it utilizes
what they call the island architecture

4274
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:23,280
what they call the island architecture
 

4275
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,209
what they call the island architecture
so you can fetch data from anywhere and

4276
01:27:26,209 --> 01:27:26,219
so you can fetch data from anywhere and
 

4277
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:28,370
so you can fetch data from anywhere and
one of the things I love about Astro is

4278
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:28,380
one of the things I love about Astro is
 

4279
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:30,649
one of the things I love about Astro is
the top level async which means that you

4280
01:27:30,649 --> 01:27:30,659
the top level async which means that you
 

4281
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:32,930
the top level async which means that you
can use a sink away or technically just

4282
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:32,940
can use a sink away or technically just
 

4283
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:35,629
can use a sink away or technically just
a weight because there's a top level of

4284
01:27:35,629 --> 01:27:35,639
a weight because there's a top level of
 

4285
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:37,430
a weight because there's a top level of
sync which means you don't have to put

4286
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
sync which means you don't have to put
 

4287
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,310
sync which means you don't have to put
that away inside of a function label to

4288
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:40,320
that away inside of a function label to
 

4289
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,669
that away inside of a function label to
sync now Gatsby is a static site

4290
01:27:43,669 --> 01:27:43,679
sync now Gatsby is a static site
 

4291
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,890
sync now Gatsby is a static site
generally the generator that uses the

4292
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:45,900
generally the generator that uses the
 

4293
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,350
generally the generator that uses the
react framework you can create pages

4294
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:48,360
react framework you can create pages
 

4295
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,750
react framework you can create pages
that are simply react components so you

4296
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:50,760
that are simply react components so you
 

4297
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,430
that are simply react components so you
can still structure everything as you

4298
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:52,440
can still structure everything as you
 

4299
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,709
can still structure everything as you
would in a regular react app but with

4300
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:54,719
would in a regular react app but with
 

4301
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,410
would in a regular react app but with
extra capabilities so one unique thing

4302
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:57,420
extra capabilities so one unique thing
 

4303
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:59,870
extra capabilities so one unique thing
about Gatsby is that it uses a graphql

4304
01:27:59,870 --> 01:27:59,880
about Gatsby is that it uses a graphql
 

4305
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:02,209
about Gatsby is that it uses a graphql
data layer that you can use to query

4306
01:28:02,209 --> 01:28:02,219
data layer that you can use to query
 

4307
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:03,890
data layer that you can use to query
data and I know I haven't gone over

4308
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:03,900
data and I know I haven't gone over
 

4309
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,050
data and I know I haven't gone over
graphql yet but I will in a little bit

4310
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:06,060
graphql yet but I will in a little bit
 

4311
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:08,570
graphql yet but I will in a little bit
it's essentially a query language to

4312
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:08,580
it's essentially a query language to
 

4313
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,149
it's essentially a query language to
query and mutate data so if you have a

4314
01:28:11,149 --> 01:28:11,159
query and mutate data so if you have a
 

4315
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:12,709
query and mutate data so if you have a
blog or something like that you can

4316
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
blog or something like that you can
 

4317
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,410
blog or something like that you can
store the posts whether it's in markdown

4318
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:15,420
store the posts whether it's in markdown
 

4319
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:18,709
store the posts whether it's in markdown
files or an API or a headless CMS Gatsby

4320
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
files or an API or a headless CMS Gatsby
 

4321
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,189
files or an API or a headless CMS Gatsby
has all kinds of features that can help

4322
01:28:22,189 --> 01:28:22,199
has all kinds of features that can help
 

4323
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:24,290
has all kinds of features that can help
you fetch that data and there's features

4324
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:24,300
you fetch that data and there's features
 

4325
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,450
you fetch that data and there's features
like image optimization code splitting

4326
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:26,460
like image optimization code splitting
 

4327
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,470
like image optimization code splitting
and more

4328
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:27,480
and more
 

4329
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,470
and more
now I know we talked about next JS when

4330
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
now I know we talked about next JS when
 

4331
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,629
now I know we talked about next JS when
in terms of static site render I'm sorry

4332
01:28:32,629 --> 01:28:32,639
in terms of static site render I'm sorry
 

4333
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:34,729
in terms of static site render I'm sorry
server side rendering but it also has

4334
01:28:34,729 --> 01:28:34,739
server side rendering but it also has
 

4335
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:37,370
server side rendering but it also has
static site generation capabilities as

4336
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:37,380
static site generation capabilities as
 

4337
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,770
static site generation capabilities as
well so there's an export command that

4338
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:39,780
well so there's an export command that
 

4339
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:43,010
well so there's an export command that
you can use to export your your project

4340
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:43,020
you can use to export your your project
 

4341
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,709
you can use to export your your project
as a static site although there are some

4342
01:28:45,709 --> 01:28:45,719
as a static site although there are some
 

4343
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:47,450
as a static site although there are some
limitations and there are some some

4344
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:47,460
limitations and there are some some
 

4345
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,490
limitations and there are some some
guidelines and conventions that you have

4346
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:49,500
guidelines and conventions that you have
 

4347
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,290
guidelines and conventions that you have
to follow in order for it to

4348
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:51,300
to follow in order for it to
 

4349
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:54,350
to follow in order for it to
successfully build as a static site and

4350
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:54,360
successfully build as a static site and
 

4351
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,390
successfully build as a static site and
next we have gridsum which is very

4352
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:56,400
next we have gridsum which is very
 

4353
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,850
next we have gridsum which is very
similar to Gatsby except it's vue.js

4354
01:28:58,850 --> 01:28:58,860
similar to Gatsby except it's vue.js
 

4355
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,370
similar to Gatsby except it's vue.js
instead of react.js so you can see that

4356
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:01,380
instead of react.js so you can see that
 

4357
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:03,290
instead of react.js so you can see that
a lot of these Frameworks copy each

4358
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:03,300
a lot of these Frameworks copy each
 

4359
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,270
a lot of these Frameworks copy each
other which isn't really a bad thing

4360
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:05,280

01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:18,890
jQuery and you basically just bring it
into your existing project and you use

4668

into your existing project and you use
 

4669
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:22,490
into your existing project and you use
custom HTML attributes to do things like

4670

moving full stack or SSR Frameworks like

4934
01:40:54,169 --> 01:40:54,179
moving full stack or SSR Frameworks like
 

4935
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:56,629
moving full stack or SSR Frameworks like
next JS to the need to know pile this

4936

year they're just getting too big and

4938
01:40:59,390 --> 01:40:59,400
year they're just getting too big and
 

4939
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,430
year they're just getting too big and
becoming the standard when using

4940
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:01,440
becoming the standard when using
 

4941
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,129
becoming the standard when using
front-end Frameworks so I know a lot of

4942
01:41:04,129 --> 01:41:04,139
front-end Frameworks so I know a lot of
 

4943
01:41:04,139 --> 01:41:07,430
front-end Frameworks so I know a lot of
developers they don't even use create

4944
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:07,440
developers they don't even use create
 

4945
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,890
developers they don't even use create
react app anymore they just jump right

4946
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:09,900
react app anymore they just jump right
 

4947
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,930
react app anymore they just jump right
into next.js and honestly the only

4948
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:11,940
into next.js and honestly the only
 

4949
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:14,209
into next.js and honestly the only
reason that I use something like create

4950
01:41:14,209 --> 01:41:14,219
reason that I use something like create
 

4951
01:41:14,219 --> 01:41:16,910
reason that I use something like create
react app is because I'm teaching and I

4952
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:16,920
react app is because I'm teaching and I
 

4953
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,430
react app is because I'm teaching and I
think it's it's good for beginners and

4954
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:19,440
think it's it's good for beginners and
 

4955
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,350
think it's it's good for beginners and
it's also good for really small projects

4956
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:21,360
it's also good for really small projects
 

4957
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,370
it's also good for really small projects
as well

4958
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:22,380
as well
 

4959
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:25,370
as well
so some bonus skills that I'd say are

4960
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:25,380
so some bonus skills that I'd say are
 

4961
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:27,530
so some bonus skills that I'd say are
are pretty much optional but very

4962
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:27,540
are pretty much optional but very
 

4963
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,750
are pretty much optional but very
beneficial and worth learning are

4964
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:29,760
beneficial and worth learning are
 

4965
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,090
beneficial and worth learning are
typescript so typescript is huge in

4966
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:32,100
typescript so typescript is huge in
 

4967
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,010
typescript so typescript is huge in
front-end development so knowing how to

4968
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:34,020
front-end development so knowing how to
 

4969
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,870
front-end development so knowing how to
use it and work with types is definitely

4970
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:35,880
use it and work with types is definitely
 

4971
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,450
use it and work with types is definitely
a plus I think learning Jam stack

4972
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:38,460
a plus I think learning Jam stack
 

4973
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,850
a plus I think learning Jam stack

4974
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:40,860
Technologies like static site generators
 

4975
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,770

01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
projects out quickly and then we have
 

4987
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,149
projects out quickly and then we have
testing and testing it really depends on

4988
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
testing and testing it really depends on
 

4989
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,250
testing and testing it really depends on
what you're trying to accomplish if you

4990
01:41:58,250 --> 01:41:58,260
what you're trying to accomplish if you
 

4991
01:41:58,260 --> 01:41:59,930
what you're trying to accomplish if you
want to write code at an Enterprise

4992
01:41:59,930 --> 01:41:59,940
want to write code at an Enterprise
 

4993
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:02,390
want to write code at an Enterprise
level company then testing is probably

4994
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:02,400
level company then testing is probably
 

4995
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,609
level company then testing is probably
in your future I wouldn't say it's a

4996
01:42:04,609 --> 01:42:04,619
in your future I wouldn't say it's a
 

4997
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:06,770
in your future I wouldn't say it's a
necessity though if you're a beginner

4998
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:06,780
necessity though if you're a beginner
 

4999
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:09,590
necessity though if you're a beginner
then I wouldn't even worry about testing

5000
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
then I wouldn't even worry about testing
 

5001
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,870
then I wouldn't even worry about testing
right now at least in my own opinion and

5002
01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:11,880
right now at least in my own opinion and
 

5003
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,270
right now at least in my own opinion and
experience alright so now we get to talk

5004
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:14,280
experience alright so now we get to talk
 

5005
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,910
experience alright so now we get to talk
about other things besides JavaScript so

5006
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:16,920
about other things besides JavaScript so
 

5007
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,709
about other things besides JavaScript so
the reason that we've talked about so

5008
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
the reason that we've talked about so
 

5009
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,570
the reason that we've talked about so
many JavaScript Technologies up to this

5010
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:20,580
many JavaScript Technologies up to this
 

5011
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:22,070
many JavaScript Technologies up to this
point is because we've just been talking

5012
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:22,080
point is because we've just been talking
 

5013
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,750
point is because we've just been talking
about about the front end for the most

5014
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:23,760
about about the front end for the most
 

5015
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,729
about about the front end for the most
part I mean we have talked about like

5016
01:42:25,729 --> 01:42:25,739
part I mean we have talked about like
 

5017
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:27,470
part I mean we have talked about like
testing and stuff like that but for the

5018
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:27,480
testing and stuff like that but for the
 

5019
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:29,570
testing and stuff like that but for the
most part these it's all been front end

5020
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:29,580
most part these it's all been front end
 

5021
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,510
most part these it's all been front end
client-side Technologies so when we move

5022
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:32,520
client-side Technologies so when we move
 

5023
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,790
client-side Technologies so when we move
to the back end to the server you can

5024
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:34,800
to the back end to the server you can
 

5025
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,609
to the back end to the server you can
use pretty much any language you want so

5026
01:42:37,609 --> 01:42:37,619
use pretty much any language you want so
 

5027
01:42:37,619 --> 01:42:39,350
use pretty much any language you want so
we'll start off with JavaScript though

5028
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:39,360
we'll start off with JavaScript though
 

5029
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,709
we'll start off with JavaScript though
node.js is a JavaScript runtime that was

5030
01:42:42,709 --> 01:42:42,719
node.js is a JavaScript runtime that was
 

5031
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,830
node.js is a JavaScript runtime that was
released in 2009 so in addition to

5032
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:45,840
released in 2009 so in addition to
 

5033
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,109
released in 2009 so in addition to
running JavaScript in the browser you

5034
01:42:48,109 --> 01:42:48,119
running JavaScript in the browser you
 

5035
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:49,850
running JavaScript in the browser you
can run it on your machine or on the

5036
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:49,860
can run it on your machine or on the
 

5037
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:51,950
can run it on your machine or on the
server and it's extremely popular in

5038
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:51,960
server and it's extremely popular in
 

5039
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:54,169
server and it's extremely popular in
full stack development because a lot of

5040
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:54,179
full stack development because a lot of
 

5041
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:56,270
full stack development because a lot of
people like to use the same language on

5042
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:56,280
people like to use the same language on
 

5043
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,270
people like to use the same language on
both the front end and the back end

5044
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:58,280
both the front end and the back end
 

5045
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:01,910
both the front end and the back end
that's something that I really enjoy and

5046
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:01,920
that's something that I really enjoy and
 

5047
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,430
that's something that I really enjoy and
it's also very fast it's scalable it's

5048
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:04,440
it's also very fast it's scalable it's
 

5049
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,129
it's also very fast it's scalable it's
great for apis and microservices there

5050
01:43:07,129 --> 01:43:07,139
great for apis and microservices there
 

5051
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:08,450
great for apis and microservices there
are some things that you wouldn't want

5052
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:08,460
are some things that you wouldn't want
 

5053
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:10,550
are some things that you wouldn't want
to use node.js for and that's typically

5054
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:10,560
to use node.js for and that's typically
 

5055
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,030
to use node.js for and that's typically
heavy computational tasks video

5056
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:14,040
heavy computational tasks video
 

5057
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,790
heavy computational tasks video
rendering machine learning stuff like

5058
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:16,800
rendering machine learning stuff like
 

5059
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,649
rendering machine learning stuff like
that these types of tasks are better

5060
01:43:18,649 --> 01:43:18,659
that these types of tasks are better
 

5061
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:20,689
that these types of tasks are better
suited for for languages that are

5062
01:43:20,689 --> 01:43:20,699
suited for for languages that are
 

5063
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:23,209
suited for for languages that are
optimized for performance like C plus

5064
01:43:23,209 --> 01:43:23,219
optimized for performance like C plus
 

5065
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:26,090
optimized for performance like C plus
plus or even python so it's good to know

5066
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:26,100
plus or even python so it's good to know
 

5067
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,070
plus or even python so it's good to know
what you want to do before you choose a

5068
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
what you want to do before you choose a
 

5069
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,169
what you want to do before you choose a
language and I'll just mention that in

5070
01:43:30,169 --> 01:43:30,179
language and I'll just mention that in
 

5071
01:43:30,179 --> 01:43:32,390
language and I'll just mention that in
addition to node.js there's a another

5072
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:32,400
addition to node.js there's a another
 

5073
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,510
addition to node.js there's a another
JavaScript runtime called Dino that was

5074
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:35,520
JavaScript runtime called Dino that was
 

5075
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,430
JavaScript runtime called Dino that was
released I don't know about three years

5076
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:37,440
released I don't know about three years
 

5077
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,129
released I don't know about three years
ago and supposedly it was going to just

5078
01:43:40,129 --> 01:43:40,139
ago and supposedly it was going to just
 

5079
01:43:40,139 --> 01:43:42,649
ago and supposedly it was going to just
ruin node.js but I haven't really heard

5080
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:42,659
ruin node.js but I haven't really heard
 

5081
01:43:42,659 --> 01:43:44,810
ruin node.js but I haven't really heard
much about it I do think there's some

5082
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:44,820
much about it I do think there's some
 

5083
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,250
much about it I do think there's some
really cool features I don't want to

5084
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:46,260
really cool features I don't want to
 

5085
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:48,709
really cool features I don't want to
trash Dino I just think it's funny how

5086
01:43:48,709 --> 01:43:48,719
trash Dino I just think it's funny how
 

5087
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:51,470
trash Dino I just think it's funny how
everybody reacted when it was released

5088
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:51,480
everybody reacted when it was released
 

5089
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,810
everybody reacted when it was released
so next we have python which is an

5090
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:53,820
so next we have python which is an
 

5091
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:55,970
so next we have python which is an
amazing language overall I don't think

5092
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:55,980
amazing language overall I don't think
 

5093
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:58,250
amazing language overall I don't think
there's another language that has as

5094
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:58,260
there's another language that has as
 

5095
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:01,370
there's another language that has as
many uses or at least I should say high

5096
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:01,380
many uses or at least I should say high
 

5097
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:03,470
many uses or at least I should say high
level languages that have as many uses

5098
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:03,480
level languages that have as many uses
 

5099
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,470
level languages that have as many uses
from automation to web development to

5100
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:06,480
from automation to web development to
 

5101
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:09,229
from automation to web development to
machine learning data science it's very

5102
01:44:09,229 --> 01:44:09,239
machine learning data science it's very
 

5103
01:44:09,239 --> 01:44:12,169
machine learning data science it's very
diverse another reason for Python's

5104
01:44:12,169 --> 01:44:12,179
diverse another reason for Python's
 

5105
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:14,270
diverse another reason for Python's
popularity is its ease of use and

5106
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:14,280
popularity is its ease of use and
 

5107
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,790
popularity is its ease of use and
readability so python code is generally

5108
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800
readability so python code is generally
 

5109
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,810
readability so python code is generally
easy to understand easy to maintain

5110
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:19,820
easy to understand easy to maintain
 

5111
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:22,490
easy to understand easy to maintain
making it a a great choice for both

5112
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:22,500
making it a a great choice for both
 

5113
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:25,490
making it a a great choice for both
beginners and experienced developers and

5114
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:25,500
beginners and experienced developers and
 

5115
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:28,189
beginners and experienced developers and
in addition python has a vast library of

5116
01:44:28,189 --> 01:44:28,199
in addition python has a vast library of
 

5117
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:30,830
in addition python has a vast library of
pre-built modules and tools which make

5118
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:30,840
pre-built modules and tools which make
 

5119
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:33,050
pre-built modules and tools which make
it easy to get started with a wide range

5120
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:33,060
it easy to get started with a wide range
 

5121
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:35,570
it easy to get started with a wide range
of projects so as far as web development

5122
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:35,580
of projects so as far as web development
 

5123
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:38,090
of projects so as far as web development
goes it has two really really great

5124
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:38,100
goes it has two really really great
 

5125
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:40,490
goes it has two really really great
Frameworks which I'll talk about in a

5126
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:40,500
Frameworks which I'll talk about in a
 

5127
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:43,910
Frameworks which I'll talk about in a
few minutes next we have PHP which is

5128
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:43,920
few minutes next we have PHP which is
 

5129
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,470
few minutes next we have PHP which is
great for what it does which is

5130
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:45,480
great for what it does which is
 

5131
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:48,290
great for what it does which is
practical web development PHP seems to

5132
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:48,300
practical web development PHP seems to
 

5133
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,689
practical web development PHP seems to
get a lot of flack although it has

5134
01:44:50,689 --> 01:44:50,699
get a lot of flack although it has
 

5135
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:52,270
get a lot of flack although it has
gotten better over the the years

5136
01:44:52,270 --> 01:44:52,280
gotten better over the the years
 

5137
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:55,370
gotten better over the the years
especially with laravel which is easily

5138
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:55,380
especially with laravel which is easily
 

5139
01:44:55,380 --> 01:45:00,290
especially with laravel which is easily

one of the really cool things about
 

5219
01:46:34,739 --> 01:46:36,950
one of the really cool things about
golang is that it's really con it has a

which reduces the need for third-party

5224
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:41,639
which reduces the need for third-party
 

5225
01:46:41,639 --> 01:46:44,030
which reduces the need for third-party
packages and Frameworks so you can

5226
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:44,040
packages and Frameworks so you can
 

5227
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:46,370
packages and Frameworks so you can
create a rest API pretty easily without

5228

create a rest API pretty easily without
 

5229
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,370
create a rest API pretty easily without
using any other third-party Frameworks

5230

using any other third-party Frameworks
 

5231
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:51,530
using any other third-party Frameworks
much easier than if you were to use like

5232
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:51,540
much easier than if you were to use like
 

5233
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:54,430
much easier than if you were to use like
node.js without Express or anything else

there are Frameworks available though
 

5237
01:46:56,699 --> 01:46:58,669
there are Frameworks available though
which I'll get to soon

5238
01:46:58,669 --> 01:46:58,679
which I'll get to soon
 

5239
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:01,910
which I'll get to soon
so Ruby is a dynamic object-oriented

5240
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:01,920
so Ruby is a dynamic object-oriented
 

5241
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:05,030
so Ruby is a dynamic object-oriented
language it has a very concise syntax in

language it has a very concise syntax in
 

5243
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,430
language it has a very concise syntax in
my opinion it's similar to python but

5244
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:07,440
my opinion it's similar to python but
 

5245
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,950
my opinion it's similar to python but
even more readable it's almost like

5246
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:09,960
even more readable it's almost like
 

5247
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:12,709
even more readable it's almost like
reading and writing English and that was

5248
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:12,719
reading and writing English and that was
 

5249
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:14,390
reading and writing English and that was
actually one of the goals for the

5250
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:14,400
actually one of the goals for the
 

5251
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,750
actually one of the goals for the
creator of Ruby a lot of people will say

5252
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:17,760
creator of Ruby a lot of people will say
 

5253
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,790
creator of Ruby a lot of people will say
that Ruby is dead I hate when people say

5254
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:19,800
that Ruby is dead I hate when people say
 

5255
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,550
that Ruby is dead I hate when people say
stuff like that because

5256
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:21,560
stuff like that because
 

5257
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:25,129
stuff like that because
if it's not cutting edge then it's just

5258
01:47:25,129 --> 01:47:25,139
if it's not cutting edge then it's just
 

5259
01:47:25,139 --> 01:47:27,709
if it's not cutting edge then it's just
dead right if it's not everywhere then

more Python and node.js jobs out there
 

5265
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:34,609
more Python and node.js jobs out there
but there's also more Python and node.js

5266

don't really see too many startups or
personal projects you using Java but

5304
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:22,739
personal projects you using Java but
 

5305
01:48:22,739 --> 01:48:25,250
personal projects you using Java but
again that's just my own experience next

5306
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:25,260
again that's just my own experience next
 

5307
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:27,350
again that's just my own experience next
we have kotlin which is very similar to

5308
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:27,360
we have kotlin which is very similar to
 

5309
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,450
we have kotlin which is very similar to
Java in fact you can use it for a lot of

5310
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:29,460
Java in fact you can use it for a lot of
 

5311
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:32,330
Java in fact you can use it for a lot of
the same projects as it is interoperable

5312
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:32,340
the same projects as it is interoperable
 

5313
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,669
the same projects as it is interoperable
with Java so it seems to be the

5314
01:48:34,669 --> 01:48:34,679
with Java so it seems to be the
 

5315
01:48:34,679 --> 01:48:36,590
with Java so it seems to be the
preference for Android apps at the

5316
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:36,600
preference for Android apps at the
 

5317
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,870
preference for Android apps at the
moment one of the key benefits of kotlin

5318
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:38,880
moment one of the key benefits of kotlin
 

5319
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:41,510
moment one of the key benefits of kotlin
is its concise syntax which makes it

5320
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,520
is its concise syntax which makes it
 

5321
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,090
is its concise syntax which makes it
easier to read and write than Java and

5322
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:44,100
easier to read and write than Java and
 

5323
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,310
easier to read and write than Java and
it is gaining popularity in the web

5324
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,320
it is gaining popularity in the web
 

5325
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,470
it is gaining popularity in the web
development or world as well I wouldn't

5326
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:48,480
development or world as well I wouldn't
 

5327
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,450
development or world as well I wouldn't
really suggest it unless you plan on

5328
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:50,460
really suggest it unless you plan on
 

5329
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,729
really suggest it unless you plan on
getting into Mobile but that's just my

5330
01:48:52,729 --> 01:48:52,739
getting into Mobile but that's just my
 

5331
01:48:52,739 --> 01:48:55,669
getting into Mobile but that's just my
opinion so rust has been blowing up for

5332
01:48:55,669 --> 01:48:55,679
opinion so rust has been blowing up for
 

5333
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:57,830
opinion so rust has been blowing up for
the past couple years it's known for its

5334
01:48:57,830 --> 01:48:57,840
the past couple years it's known for its
 

5335
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,590
the past couple years it's known for its
safety its performance concurrency it's

5336
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:00,600
safety its performance concurrency it's
 

5337
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,169
safety its performance concurrency it's
actually a systems language and is much

5338
01:49:03,169 --> 01:49:03,179
actually a systems language and is much
 

5339
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:05,209
actually a systems language and is much
lower level than the other ones that

5340
01:49:05,209 --> 01:49:05,219
lower level than the other ones that
 

5341
01:49:05,219 --> 01:49:07,250
lower level than the other ones that
I've talked about so far meaning it's

5342
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:07,260
I've talked about so far meaning it's
 

5343
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:10,370
I've talked about so far meaning it's
closer to the computer's Hardware like C

5344
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:10,380
closer to the computer's Hardware like C
 

5345
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:12,470
closer to the computer's Hardware like C
and C plus plus although it's much

5346
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:12,480
and C plus plus although it's much
 

5347
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,570
and C plus plus although it's much
easier to read and write than those two

5348
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:14,580
easier to read and write than those two
 

5349
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:17,229
easier to read and write than those two
languages so there's more abstraction

5350
01:49:17,229 --> 01:49:17,239
languages so there's more abstraction
 

5351
01:49:17,239 --> 01:49:20,270
languages so there's more abstraction
than like C C plus plus it has an

5352
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:20,280
than like C C plus plus it has an
 

5353
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:22,850
than like C C plus plus it has an
ecosystem of libraries and Frameworks I

5354
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:22,860
ecosystem of libraries and Frameworks I
 

5355
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,229
ecosystem of libraries and Frameworks I
think it's a good choice for high

5356
01:49:24,229 --> 01:49:24,239
think it's a good choice for high
 

5357
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:27,410
think it's a good choice for high
performance web applications and it's

5358
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:27,420
performance web applications and it's
 

5359
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:29,810
performance web applications and it's
also used with webassembly which I think

5360
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:29,820
also used with webassembly which I think
 

5361
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,669
also used with webassembly which I think
will be extremely popular in the future

5362
01:49:31,669 --> 01:49:31,679
will be extremely popular in the future
 

5363
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,490
will be extremely popular in the future
so and I'll talk more about webassembly

5364
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:34,500
so and I'll talk more about webassembly
 

5365
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:35,870
so and I'll talk more about webassembly
later on

5366
01:49:35,870 --> 01:49:35,880
later on
 

5367
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,750
later on
so Scala is another option for back-end

5368
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:38,760
so Scala is another option for back-end
 

5369
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,090
so Scala is another option for back-end
development it combines functional and

5370
01:49:41,090 --> 01:49:41,100
development it combines functional and
 

5371
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:43,910
development it combines functional and
object-oriented programming paradigms it

5372
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:43,920
object-oriented programming paradigms it
 

5373
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,350
object-oriented programming paradigms it
Powers the data engineering

5374
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:45,360
Powers the data engineering
 

5375
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:48,050
Powers the data engineering
infrastructure of many companies and can

5376
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:48,060
infrastructure of many companies and can
 

5377
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:51,290
infrastructure of many companies and can
also be used for creating apis and

5378
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:51,300
also be used for creating apis and
 

5379
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,790
also be used for creating apis and
microservices

5380
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:52,800
microservices
 

5381
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,689
microservices
so r or arlang is uh not a language that

5382
01:49:56,689 --> 01:49:56,699
so r or arlang is uh not a language that
 

5383
01:49:56,699 --> 01:49:59,270
so r or arlang is uh not a language that
I've ever used and it seems to be mostly

5384
01:49:59,270 --> 01:49:59,280
I've ever used and it seems to be mostly
 

5385
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,430
I've ever used and it seems to be mostly
for things like statistical Computing

5386
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:01,440
for things like statistical Computing
 

5387
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,950
for things like statistical Computing
and data analytics but it can be used

5388
01:50:03,950 --> 01:50:03,960
and data analytics but it can be used
 

5389
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:06,530
and data analytics but it can be used
for web development it does have a few

5390
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:06,540
for web development it does have a few
 

5391
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:09,890
for web development it does have a few
web Frameworks then Swift is a popular

5392
01:50:09,890 --> 01:50:09,900
web Frameworks then Swift is a popular
 

5393
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:12,050
web Frameworks then Swift is a popular
general purpose language mostly known

5394
01:50:12,050 --> 01:50:12,060
general purpose language mostly known
 

5395
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:14,930
general purpose language mostly known
for iOS development so if you want to

5396
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:14,940
for iOS development so if you want to
 

5397
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:16,790
for iOS development so if you want to
get into Mobile app Swift is definitely

5398
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
get into Mobile app Swift is definitely
 

5399
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,550
get into Mobile app Swift is definitely
going to be one of your main choices

5400
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:18,560
going to be one of your main choices
 

5401
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,010
going to be one of your main choices
this doesn't there doesn't seem to be a

5402
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:22,020
this doesn't there doesn't seem to be a
 

5403
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,629
this doesn't there doesn't seem to be a
lot of options when it comes to web

5404
01:50:23,629 --> 01:50:23,639
lot of options when it comes to web
 

5405
01:50:23,639 --> 01:50:26,149
lot of options when it comes to web
development so from what I've learned I

5406
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:26,159
development so from what I've learned I
 

5407
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:27,830
development so from what I've learned I
wouldn't suggest it unless you're

5408
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:27,840
wouldn't suggest it unless you're
 

5409
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,229
wouldn't suggest it unless you're
getting into Mobile okay so now I want

5410
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
getting into Mobile okay so now I want
 

5411
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:32,390
getting into Mobile okay so now I want
to get into some of the Frameworks that

5412
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:32,400
to get into some of the Frameworks that
 

5413
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,970
to get into some of the Frameworks that
these languages offer so back-end web

5414
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:34,980
these languages offer so back-end web
 

5415
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,950
these languages offer so back-end web
Frameworks are typically used to create

5416
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:36,960
Frameworks are typically used to create
 

5417
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:41,689
Frameworks are typically used to create
apis in microservices or to create full

5418
01:50:41,689 --> 01:50:41,699
apis in microservices or to create full
 

5419
01:50:41,699 --> 01:50:44,810
apis in microservices or to create full
applications utilizing template

5420
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:44,820
applications utilizing template
 

5421
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:47,390
applications utilizing template
languages and things like that all right

5422
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:47,400
languages and things like that all right
 

5423
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:49,550
languages and things like that all right
so they usually have tools for creating

5424
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:49,560
so they usually have tools for creating
 

5425
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,649
so they usually have tools for creating
routes or endpoints interacting with

5426
01:50:51,649 --> 01:50:51,659
routes or endpoints interacting with
 

5427
01:50:51,659 --> 01:50:53,090
routes or endpoints interacting with
databases validate getting

5428
01:50:53,090 --> 01:50:53,100
databases validate getting
 

5429
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:55,970
databases validate getting
authentication and so on some Frameworks

5430
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:55,980
authentication and so on some Frameworks
 

5431
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:58,189
authentication and so on some Frameworks
are more opinionated than others I think

5432
01:50:58,189 --> 01:50:58,199
are more opinionated than others I think
 

5433
01:50:58,199 --> 01:50:59,689
are more opinionated than others I think
that's that's important to understand

5434
01:50:59,689 --> 01:50:59,699
that's that's important to understand
 

5435
01:50:59,699 --> 01:51:02,750
that's that's important to understand
what I mean by that is some have a very

5436
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:02,760
what I mean by that is some have a very
 

5437
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,570
what I mean by that is some have a very
specific way of doing things and how you

5438
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:05,580
specific way of doing things and how you
 

5439
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:07,550
specific way of doing things and how you
set your folder and file structure up

5440
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:07,560
set your folder and file structure up
 

5441
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:09,590
set your folder and file structure up
things like that the conventions you use

5442
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:09,600
things like that the conventions you use
 

5443
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,470
things like that the conventions you use
in your code are really strict those are

5444
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:12,480
in your code are really strict those are
 

5445
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,810
in your code are really strict those are
opinionated and usually high level

5446
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:14,820
opinionated and usually high level
 

5447
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:16,910
opinionated and usually high level
Frameworks with a lot of abstraction

5448
01:51:16,910 --> 01:51:16,920
Frameworks with a lot of abstraction
 

5449
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:19,270
Frameworks with a lot of abstraction
then you have an opinion

5450
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:19,280
then you have an opinion
 

5451
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,709
then you have an opinion
unopinionated Frameworks which are

5452
01:51:21,709 --> 01:51:21,719
unopinionated Frameworks which are
 

5453
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:23,930
unopinionated Frameworks which are
usually more minimalistic and they don't

give you much out of the box however you

model view controller it's a common
 

5471
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:43,790
model view controller it's a common
design pattern that these Frameworks use

01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:43,800
design pattern that these Frameworks use
 

5473
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,370
design pattern that these Frameworks use
it basically separates the application's

01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:46,380
it basically separates the application's
 

5475
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:49,129
it basically separates the application's
concerns into three components the model

so we'll start with node.js so Express

5494
01:52:11,870 --> 01:52:11,880
so we'll start with node.js so Express

you can use MVC and express but I
 

5531
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,270
you can use MVC and express but I
wouldn't call it an MVC framework now

building apis and microservices it's
 

5543
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:17,030
building apis and microservices it's
very similar to express and syntax and

packed you have you have Adonis and Nest

5550
01:53:26,149 --> 01:53:26,159
packed you have you have Adonis and Nest
 

5551
01:53:26,159 --> 01:53:28,729
packed you have you have Adonis and Nest
JS and with both of these

JS and with both of these
 

5553
01:53:28,739 --> 01:53:31,310

you get more out of the box you're going

5554
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:31,320
you get more out of the box you're going
 

5555
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:33,350
you get more out of the box you're going
to write less code but it is they are

to write less code but it is they are
 

5557
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,270
to write less code but it is they are
more opinionated and you have to follow

5558
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:35,280
more opinionated and you have to follow
 

5559
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:38,090
more opinionated and you have to follow
certain conventions Adonis actually

5560
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:38,100
certain conventions Adonis actually

reminds me a lot of laravel's PHP

5562
01:53:41,149 --> 01:53:41,159
reminds me a lot of laravel's PHP
 

5563
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:43,189
reminds me a lot of laravel's PHP
framework so if you've ever used laravel

5564
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:43,199
framework so if you've ever used laravel
 

5565
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:44,990
framework so if you've ever used laravel
if you like that framework and you're

5566
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:45,000
if you like that framework and you're
 

5567
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,550
if you like that framework and you're
looking for a back-end JavaScript

5568
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:46,560
looking for a back-end JavaScript
 

5569
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,830
looking for a back-end JavaScript
framework then Adonis might be for you

5570
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:48,840
framework then Adonis might be for you
 

5571
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:51,530
framework then Adonis might be for you
it's MVC based you have database

5572
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:51,540
it's MVC based you have database
 

5573
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:54,350
it's MVC based you have database
migrations models controllers template

5574

migrations models controllers template
 

5575
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:57,590
migrations models controllers template
engines and more now Nest JS not next

5576
01:53:57,590 --> 01:53:57,600
engines and more now Nest JS not next
 

5577
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:00,830
engines and more now Nest JS not next
but Nest JS is another full featured

5578
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:00,840
but Nest JS is another full featured
 

5579
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:03,229
but Nest JS is another full featured
back-end framework and it actually uses

5580
01:54:03,229 --> 01:54:03,239
back-end framework and it actually uses
 

5581
01:54:03,239 --> 01:54:05,450
back-end framework and it actually uses
typescript out of the box and in my

5582
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:05,460
typescript out of the box and in my
 

5583
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:07,790
typescript out of the box and in my
opinion it feels a lot like angular so

5584
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:07,800
opinion it feels a lot like angular so
 

5585
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,010
opinion it feels a lot like angular so
it feels like angular on the back end

5586
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:10,020
it feels like angular on the back end
 

5587
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,050
it feels like angular on the back end
just the way you set up controllers and

5588
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:12,060
just the way you set up controllers and
 

5589
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:14,510
just the way you set up controllers and
so on feels very similar so I think that

5590
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:14,520
so on feels very similar so I think that
 

5591
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:17,570
so on feels very similar so I think that
angular with Nest js on the back end can

5592
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:17,580
angular with Nest js on the back end can
 

5593
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:20,750
angular with Nest js on the back end can
be a very powerful stack combo and Ness

5594
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:20,760
be a very powerful stack combo and Ness
 

5595
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,510
be a very powerful stack combo and Ness
is actually built on top of Express but

5596
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:23,520
is actually built on top of Express but
 

5597
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,330
is actually built on top of Express but
you can also configure it to use fastify

5598
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:26,340
you can also configure it to use fastify
 

5599
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:28,790
you can also configure it to use fastify
so there's a lot of other node.js friend

5600
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:28,800
so there's a lot of other node.js friend
 

5601
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,770
so there's a lot of other node.js friend
works but these are the ones that I'd

5602
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:30,780
works but these are the ones that I'd
 

5603
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:33,169
works but these are the ones that I'd
recommend so I gave you two great

5604
01:54:33,169 --> 01:54:33,179
recommend so I gave you two great
 

5605
01:54:33,179 --> 01:54:35,390
recommend so I gave you two great
minimalistic Frameworks and then two

5606
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:35,400
minimalistic Frameworks and then two
 

5607
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:38,689
minimalistic Frameworks and then two
higher level more opinionated ones all

5608
01:54:38,689 --> 01:54:38,699
higher level more opinionated ones all
 

5609
01:54:38,699 --> 01:54:40,189
higher level more opinionated ones all
right so python has some great

5610
01:54:40,189 --> 01:54:40,199
right so python has some great
 

5611
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:43,430
right so python has some great
Frameworks as well so Django is another

5612
01:54:43,430 --> 01:54:43,440
Frameworks as well so Django is another
 

5613
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,410
Frameworks as well so Django is another
one of my favorite Frameworks it's very

5614
01:54:45,410 --> 01:54:45,420
one of my favorite Frameworks it's very
 

5615
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:47,810

you to build complex web applications
 

5619
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:52,550
you to build complex web applications
with very little coding because there's

5620
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:52,560
with very little coding because there's
 

5621
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,709
with very little coding because there's
so much out of the box in fact there's

5622
01:54:54,709 --> 01:54:54,719
so much out of the box in fact there's

so much included that you can actually
 

5625
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:59,510
so much included that you can actually
use Django Without Really knowing the

use Django Without Really knowing the
 

5627
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,850
use Django Without Really knowing the
Python language you can just look at the

5628
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:01,860
Python language you can just look at the
 

5629
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:03,709
Python language you can just look at the
docs and follow the standards and

5630
01:55:03,709 --> 01:55:03,719
docs and follow the standards and
 

5631
01:55:03,719 --> 01:55:05,810
docs and follow the standards and
conventions and there's database

5632
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:05,820
conventions and there's database
 

5633
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:08,750
conventions and there's database
migrations routing there's even a

5634
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:08,760
migrations routing there's even a
 

5635
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:12,229
migrations routing there's even a
complete admin area when it comes to

5636
01:55:12,229 --> 01:55:12,239
complete admin area when it comes to
 

5637
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,149
complete admin area when it comes to
your your models so let's say you're

5638
01:55:14,149 --> 01:55:14,159
your your models so let's say you're
 

5639
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:16,750
your your models so let's say you're
creating a Blog and you create a post

5640
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:16,760
creating a Blog and you create a post
 

5641
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:19,790
creating a Blog and you create a post
resource or a post model a category

5642
01:55:19,790 --> 01:55:19,800
resource or a post model a category
 

5643
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,270
resource or a post model a category
model you can just put in a couple lines

5644
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:23,280
model you can just put in a couple lines
 

5645
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:26,030
model you can just put in a couple lines
of code and those will show up in your

5646
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:26,040
of code and those will show up in your
 

5647
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,490
of code and those will show up in your
admin area and you can then manage your

5648
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:28,500
admin area and you can then manage your
 

5649
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,590
admin area and you can then manage your
blog posts your categories you have

5650
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:30,600
blog posts your categories you have
 

5651
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:33,169
blog posts your categories you have
complete crud functionality so there's

5652
01:55:33,169 --> 01:55:33,179
complete crud functionality so there's
 

5653
01:55:33,179 --> 01:55:34,970
complete crud functionality so there's
just a ton that comes out of the box

5654
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:34,980
just a ton that comes out of the box
 

5655
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:37,490
just a ton that comes out of the box
with Django I actually created a course

5656
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:37,500
with Django I actually created a course
 

5657
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,070
with Django I actually created a course
on Django a few years ago where we built

5658
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:40,080
on Django a few years ago where we built
 

5659
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,590
on Django a few years ago where we built
a real estate website and I do have that

5660
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:42,600
a real estate website and I do have that
 

5661
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,570
a real estate website and I do have that
course available but I it does need to

5662
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:44,580
course available but I it does need to
 

5663
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:46,970
course available but I it does need to
be updated and I will be updating it

5664
01:55:46,970 --> 01:55:46,980
be updated and I will be updating it
 

5665
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,109
be updated and I will be updating it
this year

5666
01:55:48,109 --> 01:55:48,119
this year
 

5667
01:55:48,119 --> 01:55:51,050
this year
so flask is another awesome framework

5668
01:55:51,050 --> 01:55:51,060
so flask is another awesome framework
 

5669
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:53,209
so flask is another awesome framework
from python but I would say it's the

5670
01:55:53,209 --> 01:55:53,219
from python but I would say it's the
 

5671
01:55:53,219 --> 01:55:55,250
from python but I would say it's the
complete opposite of Django because it's

5672
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:55,260
complete opposite of Django because it's
 

5673
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:57,890
complete opposite of Django because it's
very minimalistic in fact I often

5674
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:57,900
very minimalistic in fact I often
 

5675
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,109
very minimalistic in fact I often
compare flash to express just the way

5676
01:56:00,109 --> 01:56:00,119
compare flash to express just the way
 

5677
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:02,209
compare flash to express just the way
that you create routes the way that you

5678
01:56:02,209 --> 01:56:02,219
that you create routes the way that you
 

5679
01:56:02,219 --> 01:56:04,790
that you create routes the way that you
use middleware is very similar so if you

5680
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:04,800
use middleware is very similar so if you
 

5681
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,950
use middleware is very similar so if you
want a framework where you have a lot of

5682
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:06,960
want a framework where you have a lot of
 

5683
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,890
want a framework where you have a lot of
freedom and you don't you know you want

5684
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:09,900
freedom and you don't you know you want
 

5685
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:11,629
freedom and you don't you know you want
to bring other packages in and stuff

5686
01:56:11,629 --> 01:56:11,639
to bring other packages in and stuff
 

5687
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:14,330
to bring other packages in and stuff
like that then flask is a great python

5688
01:56:14,330 --> 01:56:14,340
like that then flask is a great python
 

5689
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:16,669
like that then flask is a great python
framework and then I wanted to put fast

5690
01:56:16,669 --> 01:56:16,679
framework and then I wanted to put fast
 

5691
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:18,890
framework and then I wanted to put fast
API in here because it's really gaining

5692
01:56:18,890 --> 01:56:18,900
API in here because it's really gaining
 

5693
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:20,990
API in here because it's really gaining
in popularity and like the name says

5694
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:21,000
in popularity and like the name says
 

5695
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,910
in popularity and like the name says
it's very fast and it's used to build

5696
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:22,920
it's very fast and it's used to build
 

5697
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:25,970
it's very fast and it's used to build
apis so the performance is actually on

5698
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:25,980
apis so the performance is actually on
 

5699
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:28,790
apis so the performance is actually on
par with node.js and golang it also

5700
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800
par with node.js and golang it also
 

5701
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,350
par with node.js and golang it also
includes features that allow you to

5702
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:30,360
includes features that allow you to
 

5703
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,930
includes features that allow you to
write code really fast so it's robust

5704
01:56:32,930 --> 01:56:32,940
write code really fast so it's robust
 

5705
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:35,750
write code really fast so it's robust
and it's production ready it's it's

5706
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:35,760
and it's production ready it's it's
 

5707
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,390
and it's production ready it's it's
worth a look if you're into Python and

5708
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:38,400
worth a look if you're into Python and
 

5709
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,090
worth a look if you're into Python and
you're looking to create web apis

5710
01:56:41,090 --> 01:56:41,100
you're looking to create web apis
 

5711
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:43,430
you're looking to create web apis
so next we're going to look at PHP and

5712
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:43,440
so next we're going to look at PHP and
 

5713
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,669
so next we're going to look at PHP and
laravel is definitely

5714
01:56:45,669 --> 01:56:45,679
laravel is definitely
 

5715
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:48,350
laravel is definitely
the most popular framework when it comes

5716
01:56:48,350 --> 01:56:48,360
the most popular framework when it comes
 

5717
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:51,470
the most popular framework when it comes
to PHP and it's really popular just in

5718
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:51,480
to PHP and it's really popular just in
 

5719
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:54,310
to PHP and it's really popular just in
general it was first released in 2011

5720
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:54,320
general it was first released in 2011
 

5721
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:57,950
general it was first released in 2011
and has it's gained a large following

5722
01:56:57,950 --> 01:56:57,960
and has it's gained a large following
 

5723
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:00,470
and has it's gained a large following
due to its robust features as well as

5724
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:00,480
due to its robust features as well as
 

5725
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:03,530
due to its robust features as well as
its elegant syntax and ease of use so a

5726
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:03,540
its elegant syntax and ease of use so a
 

5727
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,390
its elegant syntax and ease of use so a
lot of people complain that PHP is a

5728
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:05,400
lot of people complain that PHP is a
 

5729
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:09,530
lot of people complain that PHP is a
messy language and I can agree that if

5730
01:57:09,530 --> 01:57:09,540
messy language and I can agree that if
 

5731
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,649
messy language and I can agree that if
you're using vanilla PHP then it can get

5732
01:57:12,649 --> 01:57:12,659
you're using vanilla PHP then it can get
 

5733
01:57:12,659 --> 01:57:14,570
you're using vanilla PHP then it can get
quite messy you can get a lot of what's

5734
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:14,580
quite messy you can get a lot of what's
 

5735
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:17,510
quite messy you can get a lot of what's
called spaghetti code but laravel is

5736
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,520
called spaghetti code but laravel is
 

5737
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,910
called spaghetti code but laravel is
just so clean and elegant even people

5738
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:19,920
just so clean and elegant even people
 

5739
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,850
just so clean and elegant even people
that bash PHP seem to think laravel is a

5740
01:57:22,850 --> 01:57:22,860
that bash PHP seem to think laravel is a
 

5741
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:25,430
that bash PHP seem to think laravel is a
great framework it offers a wide range

5742
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:25,440
great framework it offers a wide range
 

5743
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:28,310
great framework it offers a wide range
of built-in tools and features it has a

5744
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,320
of built-in tools and features it has a
 

5745
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,830

built-in authentication support for
 

5751
01:57:36,179 --> 01:57:39,050
built-in authentication support for
database migrations and laravel also has

develop developers so definitely my pick
 

5757
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:46,250
develop developers so definitely my pick
when it comes to PHP and definitely in

5758
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:46,260
when it comes to PHP and definitely in
 

5759
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:49,189
when it comes to PHP and definitely in
my top five Frameworks of of out of

01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:50,229
my top five Frameworks of of out of
everything

5762
01:57:50,229 --> 01:57:50,239
everything
 

5763
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:53,629
everything
symphony is another PHP framework but in

5764
01:57:53,629 --> 01:57:53,639
symphony is another PHP framework but in
 

5765
01:57:53,639 --> 01:57:56,030
symphony is another PHP framework but in
addition to being a framework it also

5766
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:56,040
addition to being a framework it also
 

5767
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:58,010
addition to being a framework it also
provides a wide range of reusable

5768
01:57:58,010 --> 01:57:58,020
provides a wide range of reusable
 

5769
01:57:58,020 --> 01:58:01,189
provides a wide range of reusable
components in fact laravel actually uses

5770
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:01,199
components in fact laravel actually uses
 

5771
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,589
components in fact laravel actually uses
several Symphony components for things

5772
01:58:03,589 --> 01:58:03,599
several Symphony components for things
 

5773
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:06,770
several Symphony components for things
like HTTP and routing so symphony is a

5774
01:58:06,770 --> 01:58:06,780
like HTTP and routing so symphony is a
 

5775
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,050
like HTTP and routing so symphony is a
it's a very decoupled framework which

5776
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:09,060
it's a very decoupled framework which
 

5777
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:11,270
it's a very decoupled framework which
means every part of the framework can be

5778
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
means every part of the framework can be
 

5779
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:14,209
means every part of the framework can be
used separately in other projects so

5780
01:58:14,209 --> 01:58:14,219
used separately in other projects so
 

5781
01:58:14,219 --> 01:58:16,310
used separately in other projects so
it's extremely powerful but it does have

5782
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:16,320
it's extremely powerful but it does have
 

5783
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,770
it's extremely powerful but it does have
a much higher learning curve at least in

5784
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:18,780
a much higher learning curve at least in
 

5785
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:21,830
a much higher learning curve at least in
my opinion and I've seen quite a quite a

5786
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:21,840
my opinion and I've seen quite a quite a
 

5787
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,890
my opinion and I've seen quite a quite a
bit of symphony in the Enterprise world

5788
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:24,900
bit of symphony in the Enterprise world
 

5789
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:27,890
bit of symphony in the Enterprise world
so if you're a beginner I don't think I

5790
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:27,900
so if you're a beginner I don't think I
 

5791
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,570
so if you're a beginner I don't think I
would suggest using Symphony over

5792
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:29,580
would suggest using Symphony over
 

5793
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:32,030
would suggest using Symphony over
something like laravel but that's just

5794
01:58:32,030 --> 01:58:32,040
something like laravel but that's just
 

5795
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,609
something like laravel but that's just
me everyone's different so next we have

5796
01:58:34,609 --> 01:58:34,619
me everyone's different so next we have
 

5797
01:58:34,619 --> 01:58:37,910
me everyone's different so next we have
my first MVC framework ever actually my

5798
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:37,920
my first MVC framework ever actually my
 

5799
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,709

5801
01:58:39,719 --> 01:58:42,410
first framework ever that I learned and
that's codeigniter so so my first real

5802
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:42,420
that's codeigniter so so my first real
 

5803
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:44,510
that's codeigniter so so my first real
complex application was created with

01:58:44,510 --> 01:58:44,520
complex application was created with
 

5805
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:47,270
complex application was created with
this framework and I used it throughout

5806
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:47,280
this framework and I used it throughout
 

5807
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,189
this framework and I used it throughout

encoding Knight of four was in
 

5817
01:58:58,619 --> 01:59:01,070
encoding Knight of four was in
development for years in fact I thought

5818
01:59:01,070 --> 01:59:01,080
development for years in fact I thought
 

5819
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:04,070
development for years in fact I thought
the framework was completely dead but in

5820
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:04,080
the framework was completely dead but in
 

5821
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,890
the framework was completely dead but in
2021 the stable version of the stable

01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:06,900
2021 the stable version of the stable
 

5823
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:09,770

version 4 was released and I think it's

5824
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:09,780
version 4 was released and I think it's
 

5825
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:11,510
version 4 was released and I think it's
a great framework especially for

5826
01:59:11,510 --> 01:59:11,520
a great framework especially for
 

5827
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,070
a great framework especially for
beginners I think it's a good

5828
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:13,080
beginners I think it's a good
 

5829
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:17,450
beginners I think it's a good
introduction to MVC where it doesn't it

5830
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:17,460
introduction to MVC where it doesn't it
 

5831
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:20,870
introduction to MVC where it doesn't it
doesn't do too much for you you know I

5832
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:20,880
doesn't do too much for you you know I
 

5833
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,910
doesn't do too much for you you know I
think with with laravel as great of a

5834
01:59:22,910 --> 01:59:22,920
think with with laravel as great of a
 

5835
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:24,830
think with with laravel as great of a
framework as it is it does a lot for you

5836

framework as it is it does a lot for you
 

5837
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:27,229
framework as it is it does a lot for you
where codeigniter makes you do more of

5838
01:59:27,229 --> 01:59:27,239
where codeigniter makes you do more of
 

5839
01:59:27,239 --> 01:59:29,390
where codeigniter makes you do more of
the work but you also start to

5840
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:29,400
the work but you also start to
 

5841
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:32,270
the work but you also start to
understand how MVC Works a little better

5842
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:32,280
understand how MVC Works a little better
 

5843
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:34,129
understand how MVC Works a little better
if I don't know if I put that into the

5844
01:59:34,129 --> 01:59:34,139
if I don't know if I put that into the
 

5845
01:59:34,139 --> 01:59:37,430
if I don't know if I put that into the
right the right words but yeah I mean it

5846
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:37,440
right the right words but yeah I mean it
 

5847
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,770
right the right words but yeah I mean it
has a light footprint good performance

5848
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:39,780
has a light footprint good performance
 

5849
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:42,109
has a light footprint good performance
and again it's easy to use not the most

5850
01:59:42,109 --> 01:59:42,119
and again it's easy to use not the most
 

5851
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:45,050
and again it's easy to use not the most
popular thing in the world but I like it

5852
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:45,060
popular thing in the world but I like it
 

5853
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:47,750
popular thing in the world but I like it
so I also wanted to mention slim PHP

5854
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:47,760
so I also wanted to mention slim PHP
 

5855
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,750
so I also wanted to mention slim PHP
which is very minimalistic and reminds

5856
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:50,760
which is very minimalistic and reminds
 

5857
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:53,570
which is very minimalistic and reminds
me of of Express only for PHP so if your

5858
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:53,580
me of of Express only for PHP so if your
 

5859
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:55,790
me of of Express only for PHP so if your
goal is to create apis and you don't

5860
01:59:55,790 --> 01:59:55,800
goal is to create apis and you don't
 

5861
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:58,609
goal is to create apis and you don't
need anything really full featured and

5862
01:59:58,609 --> 01:59:58,619
need anything really full featured and
 

5863
01:59:58,619 --> 01:59:59,930
need anything really full featured and
you want to structure your projects

5864
01:59:59,930 --> 01:59:59,940
you want to structure your projects
 

5865
01:59:59,940 --> 02:00:02,990
you want to structure your projects
however you want slim PHP may be a good

5866
02:00:02,990 --> 02:00:03,000
however you want slim PHP may be a good
 

5867
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,870
however you want slim PHP may be a good
option in fact I think that it it Brands

5868
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:05,880
option in fact I think that it it Brands
 

5869
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,910
option in fact I think that it it Brands
itself a micro framework

5870
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:07,920
itself a micro framework
 

5871
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:10,070
itself a micro framework
now if you're doing web development and

5872
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:10,080
now if you're doing web development and
 

5873
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,109
now if you're doing web development and
using the Ruby language there's a huge

5874
02:00:12,109 --> 02:00:12,119
using the Ruby language there's a huge
 

5875
02:00:12,119 --> 02:00:13,430
using the Ruby language there's a huge
chance that you're going to be learning

5876
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:13,440
chance that you're going to be learning
 

5877
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:16,370
chance that you're going to be learning
or using Ruby on Rails and I said it

5878
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:16,380
or using Ruby on Rails and I said it
 

5879
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:17,689
or using Ruby on Rails and I said it
before and I'll say it again I think

5880
02:00:17,689 --> 02:00:17,699
before and I'll say it again I think
 

5881
02:00:17,699 --> 02:00:20,030
before and I'll say it again I think
rails is one of the best Frameworks ever

5882

probably one of the most opinionated

5902
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:44,280
probably one of the most opinionated
 

5903
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:47,570
probably one of the most opinionated
Frameworks and it's it uses convention

5904
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:47,580
Frameworks and it's it uses convention
 

5905
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:50,390
Frameworks and it's it uses convention
over configuration so I think this

5906
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:50,400
over configuration so I think this
 

5907
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,729
over configuration so I think this
framework can be great for Freelancers I

10 years but they are still out there

5916
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:02,940
10 years but they are still out there
 

5917
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:05,750
10 years but they are still out there
and again I said it earlier there's not

5918
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:05,760
and again I said it earlier there's not
 

5919
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,310
and again I said it earlier there's not
as many Ruby developer as as there are

5920
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:09,320
as many Ruby developer as as there are
 

5921
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:12,350
as many Ruby developer as as there are
node.js or python developers so you do

5922
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:12,360
node.js or python developers so you do
 

5923
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:14,870
node.js or python developers so you do
have a decent shot at the jobs that are

5924
02:01:14,870 --> 02:01:14,880
have a decent shot at the jobs that are
 

5925
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:15,830
have a decent shot at the jobs that are
available

5926
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:15,840
available
 

5927
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,470
available
now in addition to Ruby on Rails you

5928
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:18,480
now in addition to Ruby on Rails you
 

5929
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,109
now in addition to Ruby on Rails you
have the Sinatra framework which is a

5930
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:21,119
have the Sinatra framework which is a
 

5931
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,729
have the Sinatra framework which is a
good alternative to rails because it's

5932
02:01:22,729 --> 02:01:22,739
good alternative to rails because it's
 

5933
02:01:22,739 --> 02:01:25,250
good alternative to rails because it's
very minimalistic and rails is very

5934
02:01:25,250 --> 02:01:25,260
very minimalistic and rails is very
 

5935
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:28,070
very minimalistic and rails is very
opinionated so Sinatra actually calls

5936
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:28,080
opinionated so Sinatra actually calls
 

5937
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,530
opinionated so Sinatra actually calls
itself a micro framework so it's good

5938
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:30,540
itself a micro framework so it's good
 

5939
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:33,770
itself a micro framework so it's good
for you know smaller apis things like

5940
02:01:33,770 --> 02:01:33,780
for you know smaller apis things like
 

5941
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:34,689
for you know smaller apis things like
that

5942
02:01:34,689 --> 02:01:34,699
that
 

5943
02:01:34,699 --> 02:01:38,689
that
so golang it has a very extensive

5944
02:01:38,689 --> 02:01:38,699
so golang it has a very extensive
 

5945
02:01:38,699 --> 02:01:40,430
so golang it has a very extensive
standard Library I think I mentioned

5946
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:40,440
standard Library I think I mentioned
 

5947
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:44,209
standard Library I think I mentioned
that in the last slide so you can do a

5948
02:01:44,209 --> 02:01:44,219
that in the last slide so you can do a
 

5949
02:01:44,219 --> 02:01:46,010
that in the last slide so you can do a
lot without a framework but there are

5950
02:01:46,010 --> 02:01:46,020
lot without a framework but there are
 

5951
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:49,129
lot without a framework but there are
still Frameworks available so jyn is

5952
02:01:49,129 --> 02:01:49,139
still Frameworks available so jyn is
 

5953
02:01:49,139 --> 02:01:50,930
still Frameworks available so jyn is
probably the most popular golang

5954
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:50,940
probably the most popular golang
 

5955
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:54,290
probably the most popular golang
framework at this time it's used to

so let's move into Java so spring is

5994
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:47,580
so let's move into Java so spring is
 

5995
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:50,209
so let's move into Java so spring is
very popular in Java world it's a

5996
02:02:50,209 --> 02:02:50,219
very popular in Java world it's a
 

5997
02:02:50,219 --> 02:02:53,270
very popular in Java world it's a
programming model and ecosystem and has

5998
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:53,280
programming model and ecosystem and has
 

5999
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,850
programming model and ecosystem and has
several parts to it including the spring

6000
02:02:55,850 --> 02:02:55,860
several parts to it including the spring
 

6001
02:02:55,860 --> 02:02:58,550
several parts to it including the spring
MVC framework which is used to create

6002
02:02:58,550 --> 02:02:58,560
MVC framework which is used to create
 

6003
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,950
MVC framework which is used to create
web applications and it seems to be

6004
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:00,960
web applications and it seems to be
 

6005
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,550
web applications and it seems to be
Java's version of of c-sharp's asp.net

6006
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:04,560
Java's version of of c-sharp's asp.net
 

6007
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,890
Java's version of of c-sharp's asp.net
MVC and I find that there's a lot of

6008
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:06,900
MVC and I find that there's a lot of
 

6009
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:09,470
MVC and I find that there's a lot of
similarities between Java and c-sharp so

6010
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:09,480
similarities between Java and c-sharp so
 

6011
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:11,330
similarities between Java and c-sharp so
if you're a Java developer and you're

6012
02:03:11,330 --> 02:03:11,340
if you're a Java developer and you're
 

6013
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:13,250
if you're a Java developer and you're
getting into web development chances are

6014
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:13,260
getting into web development chances are
 

6015
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:16,669
getting into web development chances are
you're going to learn spring and this

6016
02:03:16,669 --> 02:03:16,679
you're going to learn spring and this
 

6017
02:03:16,679 --> 02:03:19,910
you're going to learn spring and this
this just like any other Java technology

6018
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
this just like any other Java technology
 

6019
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:22,689
this just like any other Java technology
is used a lot in the Enterprise world

6020
02:03:22,689 --> 02:03:22,699
is used a lot in the Enterprise world

02:04:28,679 --> 02:04:30,589
the Java virtual machine we also have
ktor which is another lightweight

6072
02:04:30,589 --> 02:04:30,599
ktor which is another lightweight
 

6073
02:04:30,599 --> 02:04:33,410
ktor which is another lightweight
framework by jet brains that is reliable

6074
02:04:33,410 --> 02:04:33,420
framework by jet brains that is reliable
 

6075
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:34,850
framework by jet brains that is reliable
and stable

6076
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:34,860
and stable
 

6077
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:37,250
and stable
when it comes to C sharp we have

6078
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:37,260
when it comes to C sharp we have
 

6079
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:40,089
when it comes to C sharp we have
obviously the.net framework we have

6080
02:04:40,089 --> 02:04:40,099
obviously the.net framework we have
 

6081
02:04:40,099 --> 02:04:43,910
obviously the.net framework we have
asp.net core which is a cross-platform

6082
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:43,920
asp.net core which is a cross-platform
 

6083
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:46,490
asp.net core which is a cross-platform
general purpose framework obviously it

6084
02:04:46,490 --> 02:04:46,500
general purpose framework obviously it
 

6085
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:49,669
general purpose framework obviously it
uses.net and it's high performance high

6086
02:04:49,669 --> 02:04:49,679
uses.net and it's high performance high
 

6087
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:52,070
uses.net and it's high performance high
scalability it's great for large

6088
02:04:52,070 --> 02:04:52,080
scalability it's great for large
 

6089
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:55,070
scalability it's great for large
applications and then you have asp.net

6090
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:55,080
applications and then you have asp.net
 

6091
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:59,270
applications and then you have asp.net
MVC which is built on top of asp.net and

6092
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
MVC which is built on top of asp.net and
 

6093
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,189
MVC which is built on top of asp.net and
it's specifically for web applications

6094
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:01,199
it's specifically for web applications
 

6095
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:03,830
it's specifically for web applications
and obviously it implements the model

6096
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:03,840
and obviously it implements the model
 

6097
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,070
and obviously it implements the model
view controller design pattern so using

6098
02:05:07,070 --> 02:05:07,080
view controller design pattern so using
 

6099
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:10,609
view controller design pattern so using
c-sharp with asp.net is a reliable and

6100
02:05:10,609 --> 02:05:10,619
c-sharp with asp.net is a reliable and
 

6101
02:05:10,619 --> 02:05:12,709
c-sharp with asp.net is a reliable and
elegant solution for full stack web

6102
02:05:12,709 --> 02:05:12,719
elegant solution for full stack web
 

6103
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:14,450
elegant solution for full stack web
development and there's plenty of jobs

6104
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:14,460
development and there's plenty of jobs
 

6105
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:17,330
development and there's plenty of jobs
for it and then finally for rust we have

6106
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:17,340
for it and then finally for rust we have
 

6107
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:19,729
for it and then finally for rust we have
the Rockets framework which allows you

6108
02:05:19,729 --> 02:05:19,739
the Rockets framework which allows you
 

6109
02:05:19,739 --> 02:05:22,189
the Rockets framework which allows you
to create fast and secure web apps and

6110
02:05:22,189 --> 02:05:22,199
to create fast and secure web apps and
 

6111
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:24,410
to create fast and secure web apps and
it's a type safe framework I looked at

6112
02:05:24,410 --> 02:05:24,420
it's a type safe framework I looked at
 

6113
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:26,209
it's a type safe framework I looked at
some of the syntax when it comes to

6114
02:05:26,209 --> 02:05:26,219
some of the syntax when it comes to
 

6115
02:05:26,219 --> 02:05:28,970
some of the syntax when it comes to
writing routes and creating an API and

6116
02:05:28,970 --> 02:05:28,980
writing routes and creating an API and
 

6117
02:05:28,980 --> 02:05:31,129
writing routes and creating an API and
it seemed pretty clear and easy to

6118
02:05:31,129 --> 02:05:31,139
it seemed pretty clear and easy to
 

6119
02:05:31,139 --> 02:05:32,990
it seemed pretty clear and easy to
understand I've never used it personally

6120
02:05:32,990 --> 02:05:33,000
understand I've never used it personally
 

6121
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,570
understand I've never used it personally
but I did take a quick look at it all

6122
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:35,580
but I did take a quick look at it all
 

6123
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:36,649
but I did take a quick look at it all
right so now we're going to look at some

6124
02:05:36,649 --> 02:05:36,659
right so now we're going to look at some
 

6125
02:05:36,659 --> 02:05:39,109
right so now we're going to look at some
database options and no matter which

6126
02:05:39,109 --> 02:05:39,119
database options and no matter which
 

6127
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:41,209
database options and no matter which
language of framework that you use

6128
02:05:41,209 --> 02:05:41,219
language of framework that you use
 

6129
02:05:41,219 --> 02:05:42,830
language of framework that you use
you're going to be dealing with some

6130
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:42,840
you're going to be dealing with some
 

6131
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:44,990
you're going to be dealing with some
kind of database if you're building full

6132
02:05:44,990 --> 02:05:45,000
kind of database if you're building full
 

6133
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,830
kind of database if you're building full
stack applications or back-end apis now

6134
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:48,840
stack applications or back-end apis now
 

6135
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:50,689
stack applications or back-end apis now
there's different types of databases and

6136
02:05:50,689 --> 02:05:50,699
there's different types of databases and
 

6137
02:05:50,699 --> 02:05:52,310
there's different types of databases and
I and just like with anything else in

6138
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:52,320
I and just like with anything else in
 

6139
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,649
I and just like with anything else in
web development there's no clear best

6140
02:05:54,649 --> 02:05:54,659
web development there's no clear best
 

6141
02:05:54,659 --> 02:05:57,470
web development there's no clear best
option the two main types are relational

6142
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:57,480
option the two main types are relational
 

6143
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:01,550
option the two main types are relational
databases and nosql databases so I just

6144
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:01,560
databases and nosql databases so I just
 

6145
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:03,290
databases and nosql databases so I just
want to quickly go over some points for

6146
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:03,300
want to quickly go over some points for
 

6147
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:05,629
want to quickly go over some points for
each of these as they're the just like

6148
02:06:05,629 --> 02:06:05,639
each of these as they're the just like
 

6149
02:06:05,639 --> 02:06:07,850
each of these as they're the just like
with anything there's pros and cons and

6150
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:07,860
with anything there's pros and cons and
 

6151
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:09,709
with anything there's pros and cons and
there's different situations where one

6152
02:06:09,709 --> 02:06:09,719
there's different situations where one
 

6153
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:12,350
there's different situations where one
may be more beneficial than the other so

6154
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:12,360
may be more beneficial than the other so
 

6155
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,390
may be more beneficial than the other so
relational databases have been around

6156
02:06:14,390 --> 02:06:14,400
relational databases have been around
 

6157
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,790
relational databases have been around
since the 70s they've been around a long

6158
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:16,800
since the 70s they've been around a long
 

6159
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,669
since the 70s they've been around a long
time and this can be a good thing

6160
02:06:19,669 --> 02:06:19,679
time and this can be a good thing
 

6161
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:21,530
time and this can be a good thing
because we know what they're capable of

6162
02:06:21,530 --> 02:06:21,540
because we know what they're capable of
 

6163
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:23,629
because we know what they're capable of
there's lots of knowledge and support

6164
02:06:23,629 --> 02:06:23,639
there's lots of knowledge and support
 

6165
02:06:23,639 --> 02:06:26,689
there's lots of knowledge and support
out there they use a traditional table

6166
02:06:26,689 --> 02:06:26,699
out there they use a traditional table
 

6167
02:06:26,699 --> 02:06:28,970
out there they use a traditional table
structure or table based structure with

6168
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:28,980
structure or table based structure with
 

6169
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:31,070
structure or table based structure with
columns and rows so you can kind of

6170
02:06:31,070 --> 02:06:31,080
columns and rows so you can kind of
 

6171
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:34,129
columns and rows so you can kind of
think of like an Excel spreadsheet most

6172
02:06:34,129 --> 02:06:34,139
think of like an Excel spreadsheet most
 

6173
02:06:34,139 --> 02:06:37,010
think of like an Excel spreadsheet most
relational databases is use SQL which is

6174
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:37,020
relational databases is use SQL which is
 

6175
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:39,350
relational databases is use SQL which is
structured query language which if

6176
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:39,360
structured query language which if
 

6177
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,790
structured query language which if
you're going to be a back-end developer

6178
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:40,800
you're going to be a back-end developer
 

6179
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:43,729
you're going to be a back-end developer
you should definitely learn I wouldn't

6180
02:06:43,729 --> 02:06:43,739
you should definitely learn I wouldn't
 

6181
02:06:43,739 --> 02:06:46,250
you should definitely learn I wouldn't
say it's as hard as learning a regular

6182
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:46,260
say it's as hard as learning a regular
 

6183
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:48,229
say it's as hard as learning a regular
programming language there's not as much

6184
02:06:48,229 --> 02:06:48,239
programming language there's not as much
 

6185
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:50,870
programming language there's not as much
to it so learning the basics can be done

6186
02:06:50,870 --> 02:06:50,880
to it so learning the basics can be done
 

6187
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,330
to it so learning the basics can be done
pretty quickly now as the name implies

6188
02:06:53,330 --> 02:06:53,340
pretty quickly now as the name implies
 

6189
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:55,729
pretty quickly now as the name implies
these are great for relationships or

6190
02:06:55,729 --> 02:06:55,739
these are great for relationships or
 

6191
02:06:55,739 --> 02:06:57,830
these are great for relationships or
related data so let's say a social

6192
02:06:57,830 --> 02:06:57,840
related data so let's say a social
 

6193
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:00,410
related data so let's say a social
network where you have users and posts

6194
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:00,420
network where you have users and posts
 

6195
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:03,229
network where you have users and posts
friends photos and just a whole bunch of

6196
02:07:03,229 --> 02:07:03,239
friends photos and just a whole bunch of
 

6197
02:07:03,239 --> 02:07:05,629
friends photos and just a whole bunch of
data that can be related to each other

6198
02:07:05,629 --> 02:07:05,639
data that can be related to each other
 

6199
02:07:05,639 --> 02:07:08,209
data that can be related to each other
so relational databases are also very

6200
02:07:08,209 --> 02:07:08,219
so relational databases are also very
 

6201
02:07:08,219 --> 02:07:10,729
so relational databases are also very
strict and rigid when it comes to the

6202
02:07:10,729 --> 02:07:10,739
strict and rigid when it comes to the
 

6203
02:07:10,739 --> 02:07:12,589
strict and rigid when it comes to the
structure you basically need to create

6204
02:07:12,589 --> 02:07:12,599
structure you basically need to create
 

6205
02:07:12,599 --> 02:07:15,229
structure you basically need to create
your tables and then all your Fields

6206
02:07:15,229 --> 02:07:15,239
your tables and then all your Fields
 

6207
02:07:15,239 --> 02:07:17,510
your tables and then all your Fields
even the type that that of data that

6208
02:07:17,510 --> 02:07:17,520
even the type that that of data that
 

6209
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:19,729
even the type that that of data that
that field is going to hold before you

6210
02:07:19,729 --> 02:07:19,739
that field is going to hold before you
 

6211
02:07:19,739 --> 02:07:22,189
that field is going to hold before you
do anything within your application so

6212
02:07:22,189 --> 02:07:22,199
do anything within your application so
 

6213
02:07:22,199 --> 02:07:24,050
do anything within your application so
this can be a pain to deal with but then

6214
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:24,060
this can be a pain to deal with but then
 

6215
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:25,669
this can be a pain to deal with but then
again it does promote consistency

6216
02:07:25,669 --> 02:07:25,679
again it does promote consistency
 

6217
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:28,729
again it does promote consistency
security and reliability they're also

6218
02:07:28,729 --> 02:07:28,739
security and reliability they're also
 

6219
02:07:28,739 --> 02:07:30,589
security and reliability they're also
really good with complex queries that

6220
02:07:30,589 --> 02:07:30,599
really good with complex queries that
 

6221
02:07:30,599 --> 02:07:33,890
really good with complex queries that
involve multiple tables and so on so no

6222
02:07:33,890 --> 02:07:33,900
involve multiple tables and so on so no
 

6223
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:36,530
involve multiple tables and so on so no
SQL or no SQL School databases are a

6224
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:36,540
SQL or no SQL School databases are a
 

6225
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:38,330
SQL or no SQL School databases are a
newer type of database and there's

6226
02:07:38,330 --> 02:07:38,340
newer type of database and there's
 

6227
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:40,609
newer type of database and there's
actually many different types of nosql

6228
02:07:40,609 --> 02:07:40,619
actually many different types of nosql
 

6229
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:43,189
actually many different types of nosql
databases you have document databases

6230
02:07:43,189 --> 02:07:43,199
databases you have document databases
 

6231
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:46,189
databases you have document databases
column based key value stores and

6232
02:07:46,189 --> 02:07:46,199
column based key value stores and
 

6233
02:07:46,199 --> 02:07:48,109
column based key value stores and
there's there's a lot more but I'll

6234
02:07:48,109 --> 02:07:48,119
there's there's a lot more but I'll
 

6235
02:07:48,119 --> 02:07:49,729
there's there's a lot more but I'll
mostly be talking about document

6236
02:07:49,729 --> 02:07:49,739
mostly be talking about document
 

6237
02:07:49,739 --> 02:07:51,950
mostly be talking about document
databases as they seem to be the most

6238
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:51,960
databases as they seem to be the most
 

6239
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:55,070
databases as they seem to be the most
popular so data gets stored in the form

6240
02:07:55,070 --> 02:07:55,080
popular so data gets stored in the form
 

6241
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:57,290
popular so data gets stored in the form
of a document which is basically a Json

6242
02:07:57,290 --> 02:07:57,300
of a document which is basically a Json
 

6243
02:07:57,300 --> 02:08:00,169
of a document which is basically a Json
object so they're stored in collections

6244
02:08:00,169 --> 02:08:00,179
object so they're stored in collections
 

6245
02:08:00,179 --> 02:08:02,510
object so they're stored in collections
so you have collections of documents

6246
02:08:02,510 --> 02:08:02,520
so you have collections of documents
 

6247
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,669
so you have collections of documents
which again are essentially just Json

6248
02:08:04,669 --> 02:08:04,679
which again are essentially just Json
 

6249
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:07,910
which again are essentially just Json
objects key value pairs one thing about

6250
02:08:07,910 --> 02:08:07,920
objects key value pairs one thing about
 

6251
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,250
objects key value pairs one thing about
nosql databases is they're very very

6252
02:08:10,250 --> 02:08:10,260
nosql databases is they're very very
 

6253
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:12,830
nosql databases is they're very very
flexible and schema-less so you don't

6254
02:08:12,830 --> 02:08:12,840
flexible and schema-less so you don't
 

6255
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:15,410
flexible and schema-less so you don't
have to go and Define all your your

6256
02:08:15,410 --> 02:08:15,420
have to go and Define all your your
 

6257
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:17,990
have to go and Define all your your
fields and all your types and stuff like

6258
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:18,000
fields and all your types and stuff like
 

6259
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,390
fields and all your types and stuff like
that at the database level you can do

6260
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:20,400
that at the database level you can do
 

6261
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,250
that at the database level you can do
that through your application through an

6262
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:22,260
that through your application through an
 

6263
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:26,510
that through your application through an
orm or an odm object data mapper but you

6264
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:26,520
orm or an odm object data mapper but you
 

6265
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,010
orm or an odm object data mapper but you
don't have to do it at the database

6266
02:08:28,010 --> 02:08:28,020
don't have to do it at the database
 

6267
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:30,050
don't have to do it at the database
level like you do with a relational

6268
02:08:30,050 --> 02:08:30,060
level like you do with a relational
 

6269
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:33,050
level like you do with a relational
database all right so there are also

6270
02:08:33,050 --> 02:08:33,060
database all right so there are also
 

6271
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:36,169
database all right so there are also
very very scalable and you store massive

6272
02:08:36,169 --> 02:08:36,179
very very scalable and you store massive
 

6273
02:08:36,179 --> 02:08:38,390
very very scalable and you store massive
amounts of data they're not so good with

6274
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:38,400
amounts of data they're not so good with
 

6275
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,609
amounts of data they're not so good with
complex queries though so if you have

6276
02:08:40,609 --> 02:08:40,619
complex queries though so if you have
 

6277
02:08:40,619 --> 02:08:43,790
complex queries though so if you have
complex queries and lots of related data

6278
02:08:43,790 --> 02:08:43,800
complex queries and lots of related data
 

6279
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:45,410
complex queries and lots of related data
you may want to use a relational

6280
02:08:45,410 --> 02:08:45,420
you may want to use a relational
 

6281
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:48,890
you may want to use a relational
database and if you have data that is

6282
02:08:48,890 --> 02:08:48,900
database and if you have data that is
 

6283
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:51,350
database and if you have data that is
fairly simple in terms of structure but

6284
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:51,360
fairly simple in terms of structure but
 

6285
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:53,990
fairly simple in terms of structure but
you have tons and tons of it then you

6286
02:08:53,990 --> 02:08:54,000
you have tons and tons of it then you
 

6287
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,390
you have tons and tons of it then you
may want to choose nosql but I will say

6288
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:56,400
may want to choose nosql but I will say
 

6289
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,669
may want to choose nosql but I will say
that in in most projects especially

6290
02:08:58,669 --> 02:08:58,679
that in in most projects especially
 

6291
02:08:58,679 --> 02:09:00,830
that in in most projects especially
small to intermediate projects you could

6292
02:09:00,830 --> 02:09:00,840
small to intermediate projects you could
 

6293
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:03,169
small to intermediate projects you could
use either one all right so now we're

6294
02:09:03,169 --> 02:09:03,179
use either one all right so now we're
 

6295
02:09:03,179 --> 02:09:05,629
use either one all right so now we're
going to get into the actual database

6296
02:09:05,629 --> 02:09:05,639
going to get into the actual database
 

6297
02:09:05,639 --> 02:09:08,990
going to get into the actual database
Management systems or dbms's so we're

6298
02:09:08,990 --> 02:09:09,000
Management systems or dbms's so we're
 

6299
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,669
Management systems or dbms's so we're
going to start with the relational ones

6300
02:09:10,669 --> 02:09:10,679
going to start with the relational ones
 

6301
02:09:10,679 --> 02:09:13,250
going to start with the relational ones
and then we'll move to nosql and then

6302
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:13,260
and then we'll move to nosql and then
 

6303
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:15,050
and then we'll move to nosql and then
we'll also look at some other types as

6304
02:09:15,050 --> 02:09:15,060
we'll also look at some other types as
 

6305
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:18,410
we'll also look at some other types as
well Cloud databases file based Etc so

6306
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:18,420
well Cloud databases file based Etc so
 

6307
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:21,830
well Cloud databases file based Etc so
postgres or postgresql or postgres SQL

6308
02:09:21,830 --> 02:09:21,840

however you want to pronounce it is a

6310
02:09:24,169 --> 02:09:24,179
however you want to pronounce it is a
 

6311
02:09:24,179 --> 02:09:26,270
however you want to pronounce it is a
relational database that has intuitive

6312
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:26,280
relational database that has intuitive
 

6313
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:29,629
relational database that has intuitive
functionality and versatile security so

6314
02:09:29,629 --> 02:09:29,639
functionality and versatile security so
 

6315
02:09:29,639 --> 02:09:31,790
functionality and versatile security so
it's also known as an object-oriented

6316
02:09:31,790 --> 02:09:31,800
it's also known as an object-oriented
 

6317
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:34,250
it's also known as an object-oriented
database this makes it easy to work with

6318

complex data mod models and
 

6321
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:38,030
complex data mod models and
relationships and it provides a more

6322
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:38,040
relationships and it provides a more
 

6323
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:39,830
relationships and it provides a more
intuitive way to interact with the

via SQL structure query language there

6402
02:11:24,109 --> 02:11:24,119
via SQL structure query language there
 

6403
02:11:24,119 --> 02:11:26,750
via SQL structure query language there
are variations of the language but it's

6404
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:26,760
are variations of the language but it's
 

6405
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:28,850
are variations of the language but it's
pretty easy to transition from one to

another
all right so now we're going to look at

6410
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:31,020
all right so now we're going to look at
 

6411
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:34,010
all right so now we're going to look at
some nosql databases or nosql I know a

SQL but mongodb is probably the most

6416
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:39,360
SQL but mongodb is probably the most
 

6417
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:42,950
SQL but mongodb is probably the most
popular one it's a document database and

6418
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:42,960
popular one it's a document database and
 

6419
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,109
popular one it's a document database and
like I said data stored in documents

6420
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:45,119
like I said data stored in documents
 

6421
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:47,510
like I said data stored in documents
which are formatted like like Json

6422
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:47,520
which are formatted like like Json
 

6423
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:50,450
which are formatted like like Json
objects in fact mongodb uses something

6424
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:50,460
objects in fact mongodb uses something
 

6425
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:53,930
objects in fact mongodb uses something
called Beeson which is a or bson which

6426
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:53,940
called Beeson which is a or bson which
 

6427
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:58,010
called Beeson which is a or bson which
is a superset of Json and I think one

6428
02:11:58,010 --> 02:11:58,020
is a superset of Json and I think one
 

6429
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:00,950
is a superset of Json and I think one
big reason why is so popular in

6430
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:00,960
big reason why is so popular in
 

6431
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,709
big reason why is so popular in
the JavaScript world or node.js world is

the JavaScript world or node.js world is
 

6433
02:12:03,719 --> 02:12:05,870

probably say stick with mongodb just
 

6459
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:38,450
probably say stick with mongodb just

also Netflix and Airbnb now I will say

6508
02:13:40,189 --> 02:13:40,199
also Netflix and Airbnb now I will say
 

6509
02:13:40,199 --> 02:13:43,250
also Netflix and Airbnb now I will say
that most of these nosql databases with

data sets so if you're creating a

6516
02:13:49,609 --> 02:13:49,619
data sets so if you're creating a
 

6517
02:13:49,619 --> 02:13:51,830
data sets so if you're creating a
personal blog you're probably not going

02:13:51,830 --> 02:13:51,840
personal blog you're probably not going
 

6519
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,750
personal blog you're probably not going
to use couchbase you're probably going

6520
02:13:53,750 --> 02:13:53,760
to use couchbase you're probably going
 

6521
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:56,629
to use couchbase you're probably going
to use something like postgres MySQL or

6522
02:13:56,629 --> 02:13:56,639
to use something like postgres MySQL or
 

6523
02:13:56,639 --> 02:13:58,250
to use something like postgres MySQL or
even mongodb

6524
02:13:58,250 --> 02:13:58,260
even mongodb
 

6525
02:13:58,260 --> 02:14:00,530
even mongodb
so now I want to look at serverless or

6526
02:14:00,530 --> 02:14:00,540
so now I want to look at serverless or
 

6527
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:02,689
so now I want to look at serverless or
Cloud databases these are extremely

6528
02:14:02,689 --> 02:14:02,699
Cloud databases these are extremely
 

6529
02:14:02,699 --> 02:14:05,810
Cloud databases these are extremely
popular in 2023 and Beyond these are

6530
02:14:05,810 --> 02:14:05,820
popular in 2023 and Beyond these are
 

6531
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:08,149
popular in 2023 and Beyond these are
databases that are obviously hosted in

6532
02:14:08,149 --> 02:14:08,159
databases that are obviously hosted in
 

6533
02:14:08,159 --> 02:14:10,010
databases that are obviously hosted in
the cloud so you don't have to install

6534
02:14:10,010 --> 02:14:10,020
the cloud so you don't have to install
 

6535
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:12,830
the cloud so you don't have to install
and manage them on your own server and I

6536
02:14:12,830 --> 02:14:12,840
and manage them on your own server and I
 

6537
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:14,990
and manage them on your own server and I
think that this is the general direction

6538
02:14:14,990 --> 02:14:15,000
think that this is the general direction
 

6539
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,149
think that this is the general direction
that we're going in when it comes to

6540
02:14:17,149 --> 02:14:17,159
that we're going in when it comes to
 

6541
02:14:17,159 --> 02:14:19,069
that we're going in when it comes to
data they provide scalability

6542
02:14:19,069 --> 02:14:19,079
data they provide scalability
 

6543
02:14:19,079 --> 02:14:21,410
data they provide scalability
flexibility and you don't have to worry

6544
02:14:21,410 --> 02:14:21,420
flexibility and you don't have to worry
 

6545
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:22,970
flexibility and you don't have to worry
about the infrastructure and the

6546
02:14:22,970 --> 02:14:22,980
about the infrastructure and the
 

6547
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:24,709
about the infrastructure and the
maintenance so we'll start off with

6548
02:14:24,709 --> 02:14:24,719
maintenance so we'll start off with
 

6549
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:27,050
maintenance so we'll start off with
mongodb Atlas which is the cloud version

6550
02:14:27,050 --> 02:14:27,060
mongodb Atlas which is the cloud version
 

6551
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:29,629
mongodb Atlas which is the cloud version
of mongodb and it's actually what they

6552
02:14:29,629 --> 02:14:29,639
of mongodb and it's actually what they
 

6553
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:32,149
of mongodb and it's actually what they
suggest using over you know a local

6554
02:14:32,149 --> 02:14:32,159
suggest using over you know a local
 

6555
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:35,030
suggest using over you know a local
implementation and as with the rest of

6556
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:35,040
implementation and as with the rest of
 

6557
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:36,530
implementation and as with the rest of
these options there's a very generous

6558
02:14:36,530 --> 02:14:36,540
these options there's a very generous
 

6559
02:14:36,540 --> 02:14:39,050
these options there's a very generous
free tier and then it's pay as you go

6560
02:14:39,050 --> 02:14:39,060
free tier and then it's pay as you go
 

6561
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:41,569
free tier and then it's pay as you go
once you go into production if it's you

6562
02:14:41,569 --> 02:14:41,579
once you go into production if it's you
 

6563
02:14:41,579 --> 02:14:43,550
once you go into production if it's you
know more than just a simple personal

6564
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:43,560
know more than just a simple personal
 

6565
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:45,830
know more than just a simple personal
website or something like that then

6566
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:45,840
website or something like that then
 

6567
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,689
website or something like that then
you'll you just pay as you go and it's

6568
02:14:47,689 --> 02:14:47,699
you'll you just pay as you go and it's
 

6569
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:49,129
you'll you just pay as you go and it's
great because you can set up your

6570
02:14:49,129 --> 02:14:49,139
great because you can set up your
 

6571
02:14:49,139 --> 02:14:51,109
great because you can set up your
development database while you're

6572
02:14:51,109 --> 02:14:51,119
development database while you're
 

6573
02:14:51,119 --> 02:14:53,510
development database while you're
developing and then just switch to your

6574
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:53,520
developing and then just switch to your
 

6575
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:55,669
developing and then just switch to your
production database when you deploy and

6576
02:14:55,669 --> 02:14:55,679
production database when you deploy and
 

6577
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:57,470
production database when you deploy and
it's as easy as just swapping out the

6578
02:14:57,470 --> 02:14:57,480
it's as easy as just swapping out the
 

6579
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:00,290
it's as easy as just swapping out the
database string in your back end you

6580
02:15:00,290 --> 02:15:00,300
database string in your back end you
 

6581
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:02,209
database string in your back end you
don't have to do any extra installations

6582
02:15:02,209 --> 02:15:02,219
don't have to do any extra installations
 

6583
02:15:02,219 --> 02:15:04,609
don't have to do any extra installations
or any work on a server or anything like

6584
02:15:04,609 --> 02:15:04,619
or any work on a server or anything like
 

6585
02:15:04,619 --> 02:15:07,189
or any work on a server or anything like
that it's very secure you can make it so

6586
02:15:07,189 --> 02:15:07,199
that it's very secure you can make it so
 

6587
02:15:07,199 --> 02:15:09,830
that it's very secure you can make it so
that only your development IP and your

6588
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
that only your development IP and your
 

6589
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,890
that only your development IP and your
production server IP can access it you

6590
02:15:12,890 --> 02:15:12,900
production server IP can access it you
 

6591
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:15,770
production server IP can access it you
can access your data via the browser but

6592
02:15:15,770 --> 02:15:15,780
can access your data via the browser but
 

6593
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:18,830
can access your data via the browser but
there is a much more intuitive desktop

6594
02:15:18,830 --> 02:15:18,840
there is a much more intuitive desktop
 

6595
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:21,649
there is a much more intuitive desktop
app called mongodb Compass if you want

6596
02:15:21,649 --> 02:15:21,659
app called mongodb Compass if you want
 

6597
02:15:21,659 --> 02:15:23,870
app called mongodb Compass if you want
to manage your data directly you know

6598
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:23,880
to manage your data directly you know
 

6599
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:25,669
to manage your data directly you know
right in the database not through any

6600
02:15:25,669 --> 02:15:25,679
right in the database not through any
 

6601
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:27,050
right in the database not through any
application

6602
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:27,060
application
 

6603
02:15:27,060 --> 02:15:29,750
application
so next we have Firebase which is owned

6604
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:29,760
so next we have Firebase which is owned
 

6605
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:32,810
so next we have Firebase which is owned
by Google and offers a real-time nosql

6606
02:15:32,810 --> 02:15:32,820
by Google and offers a real-time nosql
 

6607
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:35,089
by Google and offers a real-time nosql
database as well as a lot more it's

6608
02:15:35,089 --> 02:15:35,099
database as well as a lot more it's
 

6609
02:15:35,099 --> 02:15:37,729
database as well as a lot more it's
actually an entire platform so it offers

6610
02:15:37,729 --> 02:15:37,739
actually an entire platform so it offers
 

6611
02:15:37,739 --> 02:15:40,129
actually an entire platform so it offers
things like authentication file storage

6612
02:15:40,129 --> 02:15:40,139
things like authentication file storage
 

6613
02:15:40,139 --> 02:15:42,530
things like authentication file storage
serverless functions so it's essentially

6614
02:15:42,530 --> 02:15:42,540
serverless functions so it's essentially
 

6615
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:44,450
serverless functions so it's essentially
an entire platform for building

6616
02:15:44,450 --> 02:15:44,460
an entire platform for building
 

6617
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:46,729
an entire platform for building
applications and it's great for small to

6618
02:15:46,729 --> 02:15:46,739
applications and it's great for small to
 

6619
02:15:46,739 --> 02:15:49,310
applications and it's great for small to
medium-sized projects the one downside

6620
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:49,320
medium-sized projects the one downside
 

6621
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,530
medium-sized projects the one downside
is that you are tied into Google's

6622
02:15:51,530 --> 02:15:51,540
is that you are tied into Google's
 

6623
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:53,390
is that you are tied into Google's
architecture for everything if you do

6624
02:15:53,390 --> 02:15:53,400
architecture for everything if you do
 

6625
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:55,970
architecture for everything if you do
use Firebase now another option that you

6626
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:55,980
use Firebase now another option that you
 

6627
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:57,890
use Firebase now another option that you
have which is very similar to Firebase

6628
02:15:57,890 --> 02:15:57,900
have which is very similar to Firebase
 

6629
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:00,649
have which is very similar to Firebase
is Super Bass and Super Bass is really

6630
02:16:00,649 --> 02:16:00,659
is Super Bass and Super Bass is really
 

6631
02:16:00,659 --> 02:16:04,189
is Super Bass and Super Bass is really
blown up in 2022 and 2023 so it's

6632
02:16:04,189 --> 02:16:04,199
blown up in 2022 and 2023 so it's
 

6633
02:16:04,199 --> 02:16:06,649
blown up in 2022 and 2023 so it's
essentially a back end as a service so

6634
02:16:06,649 --> 02:16:06,659
essentially a back end as a service so
 

6635
02:16:06,659 --> 02:16:08,270
essentially a back end as a service so
again you don't have to install or

6636
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:08,280
again you don't have to install or
 

6637
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:10,729
again you don't have to install or
manage any databases it does offer

6638
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:10,739
manage any databases it does offer
 

6639
02:16:10,739 --> 02:16:13,069
manage any databases it does offer
authentication there are some

6640
02:16:13,069 --> 02:16:13,079
authentication there are some
 

6641
02:16:13,079 --> 02:16:15,229
authentication there are some
differences with Firebase versus Super

6642
02:16:15,229 --> 02:16:15,239
differences with Firebase versus Super
 

6643
02:16:15,239 --> 02:16:17,810
differences with Firebase versus Super
Bass Super Bass is actually built on top

6644
02:16:17,810 --> 02:16:17,820
Bass Super Bass is actually built on top
 

6645
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:21,169
Bass Super Bass is actually built on top
of a postgres database while Firebase is

6646
02:16:21,169 --> 02:16:21,179
of a postgres database while Firebase is
 

6647
02:16:21,179 --> 02:16:23,870
of a postgres database while Firebase is
built on top of a nosql database another

6648
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:23,880
built on top of a nosql database another
 

6649
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:25,490
built on top of a nosql database another
important thing to mention is that super

6650
02:16:25,490 --> 02:16:25,500
important thing to mention is that super
 

6651
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:27,709
important thing to mention is that super
bass is not a proprietary piece of

6652
02:16:27,709 --> 02:16:27,719
bass is not a proprietary piece of
 

6653
02:16:27,719 --> 02:16:30,169
bass is not a proprietary piece of
software like Firebase so since it's an

6654
02:16:30,169 --> 02:16:30,179
software like Firebase so since it's an
 

6655
02:16:30,179 --> 02:16:32,629
software like Firebase so since it's an
open source project that uses an open

6656
02:16:32,629 --> 02:16:32,639
open source project that uses an open
 

6657
02:16:32,639 --> 02:16:36,349
open source project that uses an open
source database postgres then you're not

6658
02:16:36,349 --> 02:16:36,359
source database postgres then you're not
 

6659
02:16:36,359 --> 02:16:38,929
source database postgres then you're not
locked into any one particular vendor

6660
02:16:38,929 --> 02:16:38,939
locked into any one particular vendor
 

6661
02:16:38,939 --> 02:16:41,629
locked into any one particular vendor
like you are with Firebase in Google

6662
02:16:41,629 --> 02:16:41,639
like you are with Firebase in Google
 

6663
02:16:41,639 --> 02:16:43,849
like you are with Firebase in Google
now fauna DB is another one that I've

6664
02:16:43,849 --> 02:16:43,859
now fauna DB is another one that I've
 

6665
02:16:43,859 --> 02:16:46,370
now fauna DB is another one that I've
seen a lot of this past year what's cool

6666
02:16:46,370 --> 02:16:46,380
seen a lot of this past year what's cool
 

6667
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:48,349
seen a lot of this past year what's cool
about fauna is that they offer both

6668
02:16:48,349 --> 02:16:48,359
about fauna is that they offer both
 

6669
02:16:48,359 --> 02:16:51,410
about fauna is that they offer both
nosql and relational data models and

6670
02:16:51,410 --> 02:16:51,420
nosql and relational data models and
 

6671
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:53,330
nosql and relational data models and
they also provide Advanced features such

6672
02:16:53,330 --> 02:16:53,340
they also provide Advanced features such
 

6673
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:56,570
they also provide Advanced features such
as support for acid transactions they

6674
02:16:56,570 --> 02:16:56,580
as support for acid transactions they
 

6675
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:58,730
as support for acid transactions they
have native support for graphql as well

6676
02:16:58,730 --> 02:16:58,740
have native support for graphql as well
 

6677
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:01,910
have native support for graphql as well
and then AWS also offers a lot of

6678
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:01,920
and then AWS also offers a lot of
 

6679
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:04,429
and then AWS also offers a lot of
options there's RDS which is Amazon's

6680
02:17:04,429 --> 02:17:04,439
options there's RDS which is Amazon's
 

6681
02:17:04,439 --> 02:17:06,349
options there's RDS which is Amazon's
relational data service where you can

6682
02:17:06,349 --> 02:17:06,359
relational data service where you can
 

6683
02:17:06,359 --> 02:17:08,330
relational data service where you can
have a postgres database in the cloud

6684
02:17:08,330 --> 02:17:08,340
have a postgres database in the cloud
 

6685
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:10,190
have a postgres database in the cloud
that's something I've used a few times

6686
02:17:10,190 --> 02:17:10,200
that's something I've used a few times
 

6687
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:11,349
that's something I've used a few times
as well

6688
02:17:11,349 --> 02:17:11,359
as well
 

6689
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:13,929
as well
now I want to talk a little bit about

6690
02:17:13,929 --> 02:17:13,939
now I want to talk a little bit about
 

6691
02:17:13,939 --> 02:17:17,270
now I want to talk a little bit about
file based databases which are used for

6692
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:17,280
file based databases which are used for
 

6693

also keeps our application independent
of the database so if you wanted to

6814
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:44,880
of the database so if you wanted to
 

6815
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:47,929
of the database so if you wanted to
build an app around let's say MySQL and

and many other features so if you need

6856
02:20:42,290 --> 02:20:42,300
and many other features so if you need
 

6857
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:45,290
and many other features so if you need
just a general orm or database client

6858

just a general orm or database client
 

6859
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:48,050
just a general orm or database client
that's what I would suggest now if you

6860
02:20:48,050 --> 02:20:48,060
that's what I would suggest now if you
 

6861
02:20:48,060 --> 02:20:50,530
that's what I would suggest now if you
happen to be using node.js with mongodb

6862
02:20:50,530 --> 02:20:50,540
happen to be using node.js with mongodb

all right so when we create a backend

6924
02:22:13,370 --> 02:22:13,380
all right so when we create a backend

can take two of the most common uh rest
apis and graphql now rest stands for

6930
02:22:21,710 --> 02:22:21,720
apis and graphql now rest stands for
 

6931
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:24,469
apis and graphql now rest stands for
representational State transfer and it's

6932
02:22:24,469 --> 02:22:24,479
representational State transfer and it's
 

6933
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:26,630
representational State transfer and it's
a software architecture style for

6934
02:22:26,630 --> 02:22:26,640
a software architecture style for

building scalable and flexible web
 

6937
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:30,889
building scalable and flexible web
services now you should really be

6938
02:22:30,889 --> 02:22:30,899
services now you should really be
 

6939
02:22:30,899 --> 02:22:33,590
services now you should really be
familiar with rest if you're already a

6940
02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:33,600
familiar with rest if you're already a
 

6941
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:35,389
familiar with rest if you're already a
front-end developer because you should

6942
02:22:35,389 --> 02:22:35,399
front-end developer because you should
 

6943
02:22:35,399 --> 02:22:37,849
front-end developer because you should
be able to consume rest apis from the

6944
02:22:37,849 --> 02:22:37,859
be able to consume rest apis from the
 

6945
02:22:37,859 --> 02:22:40,190
be able to consume rest apis from the
client and this knowledge will help you

6946
02:22:40,190 --> 02:22:40,200
client and this knowledge will help you
 

6947
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:42,530
client and this knowledge will help you
when it comes to creating them as well

6948
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:42,540
when it comes to creating them as well
 

6949
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:45,710
when it comes to creating them as well
so rest is the traditional client server

6950
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:45,720
so rest is the traditional client server
 

6951
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:48,110
so rest is the traditional client server
model and it's much more common than

6952
02:22:48,110 --> 02:22:48,120
model and it's much more common than
 

6953
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:51,349
model and it's much more common than
graphql and it uses specific HTTP

6954
02:22:51,349 --> 02:22:51,359
graphql and it uses specific HTTP
 

6955
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:55,610
graphql and it uses specific HTTP
methods and endpoints or URLs which are

6956
02:22:55,610 --> 02:22:55,620
methods and endpoints or URLs which are
 

6957
02:22:55,620 --> 02:22:58,250
methods and endpoints or URLs which are
formatted in a certain way now with rest

6958
02:22:58,250 --> 02:22:58,260
formatted in a certain way now with rest
 

6959
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:00,770
formatted in a certain way now with rest
you can fetch data from a route so let's

6960
02:23:00,770 --> 02:23:00,780
you can fetch data from a route so let's
 

6961
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:04,790
you can fetch data from a route so let's
say whatever mywebsite.com API slash

6962
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:04,800
say whatever mywebsite.com API slash
 

6963
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,950
say whatever mywebsite.com API slash
posts so you would fetch all the blog

6964
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:06,960
posts so you would fetch all the blog
 

6965
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:09,050
posts so you would fetch all the blog
posts from that specific endpoint or

6966
02:23:09,050 --> 02:23:09,060
posts from that specific endpoint or
 

6967
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:11,330
posts from that specific endpoint or
that URL and then you would get all all

6968
02:23:11,330 --> 02:23:11,340
that URL and then you would get all all
 

6969
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:14,150
that URL and then you would get all all
the data back from from that endpoint

6970
02:23:14,150 --> 02:23:14,160
the data back from from that endpoint
 

6971
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,550
the data back from from that endpoint
and you could use any language any

6972
02:23:16,550 --> 02:23:16,560
and you could use any language any
 

6973
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:18,889
and you could use any language any
server side language in any database you

6974
02:23:18,889 --> 02:23:18,899
server side language in any database you
 

6975
02:23:18,899 --> 02:23:21,349
server side language in any database you
could create a rest API with node.js and

6976
02:23:21,349 --> 02:23:21,359
could create a rest API with node.js and
 

6977
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:25,670
could create a rest API with node.js and
mongodb or with Java and MySQL or

6978
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:25,680
mongodb or with Java and MySQL or
 

6979

whatever language you want now graphql

6980
02:23:28,969 --> 02:23:28,979
whatever language you want now graphql
 

6981
02:23:28,979 --> 02:23:31,309
whatever language you want now graphql
is a bit different so graphql is a query

6982
02:23:31,309 --> 02:23:31,319
is a bit different so graphql is a query
 

6983
02:23:31,319 --> 02:23:34,550
is a bit different so graphql is a query
language and runtime for apis and it

6984
02:23:34,550 --> 02:23:34,560
language and runtime for apis and it
 

6985
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:37,010
language and runtime for apis and it
allows clients to request the exact data

6986
02:23:37,010 --> 02:23:37,020
allows clients to request the exact data
 

6987
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:39,650
allows clients to request the exact data
they need in a single request and it

6988
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:39,660
they need in a single request and it
 

6989
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:42,410
they need in a single request and it
uses a flexible and expressive query

6990
02:23:42,410 --> 02:23:42,420
uses a flexible and expressive query
 

6991
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:45,110
uses a flexible and expressive query
language so this can lead to performance

6992
02:23:45,110 --> 02:23:45,120
language so this can lead to performance
 

6993
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:47,210
language so this can lead to performance
improvements especially for mobile and

6994
02:23:47,210 --> 02:23:47,220
improvements especially for mobile and
 

6995
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:50,389
improvements especially for mobile and
web applications with rest well let's

6996
02:23:50,389 --> 02:23:50,399
web applications with rest well let's
 

6997
02:23:50,399 --> 02:23:53,750
web applications with rest well let's
say you have a an app where a user can

6998
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:53,760
say you have a an app where a user can
 

6999
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:56,330
say you have a an app where a user can
create read update and delete blog posts

7000
02:23:56,330 --> 02:23:56,340
create read update and delete blog posts
 

7001
02:23:56,340 --> 02:23:58,969
create read update and delete blog posts
so you would have four separate URLs or

7002
02:23:58,969 --> 02:23:58,979
so you would have four separate URLs or
 

7003
02:23:58,979 --> 02:24:00,950
so you would have four separate URLs or
four separate endpoints to hit on the

7004
02:24:00,950 --> 02:24:00,960
four separate endpoints to hit on the
 

7005
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:03,530
four separate endpoints to hit on the
back end to commit any of those actions

7006
02:24:03,530 --> 02:24:03,540
back end to commit any of those actions
 

7007
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:07,190
back end to commit any of those actions
and if you wanted to get a blog post you

7008
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:07,200
and if you wanted to get a blog post you
 

7009
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:09,590
and if you wanted to get a blog post you
would have to fetch every field in that

7010
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:09,600
would have to fetch every field in that
 

7011
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:12,889
would have to fetch every field in that
post the title The body the date the

7012
02:24:12,889 --> 02:24:12,899
post the title The body the date the
 

7013
02:24:12,899 --> 02:24:15,469
post the title The body the date the
user or author all the fields you get

7014
02:24:15,469 --> 02:24:15,479
user or author all the fields you get
 

7015
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:17,990
user or author all the fields you get
back with graphql you have one single

7016
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:18,000
back with graphql you have one single
 

7017
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,990
back with graphql you have one single
endpoint which is just slash graphql and

7018
02:24:20,990 --> 02:24:21,000
endpoint which is just slash graphql and
 

7019
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,969
endpoint which is just slash graphql and
instead of making a standard HTTP

7020
02:24:22,969 --> 02:24:22,979
instead of making a standard HTTP
 

7021
02:24:22,979 --> 02:24:25,610
instead of making a standard HTTP
request you make a query which looks a

7022
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:25,620
request you make a query which looks a
 

7023
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:28,790
request you make a query which looks a
lot like Json and you can specify well I

7024
02:24:28,790 --> 02:24:28,800
lot like Json and you can specify well I
 

7025
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,770
lot like Json and you can specify well I
want just the title and the body from

7026
02:24:30,770 --> 02:24:30,780
want just the title and the body from
 

7027
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:33,309
want just the title and the body from
the blog post from with it with this ID

7028
02:24:33,309 --> 02:24:33,319
the blog post from with it with this ID
 

7029
02:24:33,319 --> 02:24:37,190
the blog post from with it with this ID
so you can specify exactly what you want

7030
02:24:37,190 --> 02:24:37,200
so you can specify exactly what you want
 

7031
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:39,770
so you can specify exactly what you want
where with rest it's more All or Nothing

7032
02:24:39,770 --> 02:24:39,780
where with rest it's more All or Nothing
 

7033
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:42,770
where with rest it's more All or Nothing
All right so that does increase

7034
02:24:42,770 --> 02:24:42,780
All right so that does increase
 

7035
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:45,349
All right so that does increase
performance and there's there's a lot of

7036
02:24:45,349 --> 02:24:45,359
performance and there's there's a lot of
 

7037
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:48,469
performance and there's there's a lot of
Pros to that but graphql is also harder

7038
02:24:48,469 --> 02:24:48,479
Pros to that but graphql is also harder
 

7039
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:50,450
Pros to that but graphql is also harder
to set up it's another layer that you

7040
02:24:50,450 --> 02:24:50,460
to set up it's another layer that you
 

7041
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:53,270
to set up it's another layer that you
have to worry about you can use graphql

7042
02:24:53,270 --> 02:24:53,280
have to worry about you can use graphql
 

7043
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,730
have to worry about you can use graphql
with a rest API they're not mutually

7044
02:24:55,730 --> 02:24:55,740
with a rest API they're not mutually
 

7045
02:24:55,740 --> 02:24:58,370
with a rest API they're not mutually
exclusive but with that said I think

7046
02:24:58,370 --> 02:24:58,380
exclusive but with that said I think
 

7047
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:01,010
exclusive but with that said I think
that learning restful apis it's

7048
02:25:01,010 --> 02:25:01,020
that learning restful apis it's
 

7049
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:03,170
that learning restful apis it's
mandatory for full stack and and

7050
02:25:03,170 --> 02:25:03,180
mandatory for full stack and and
 

7051
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:06,230
mandatory for full stack and and
back-end developers graphql is it's a

7052
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:06,240
back-end developers graphql is it's a
 

7053
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:08,210
back-end developers graphql is it's a
nice technology to know it can help you

7054
02:25:08,210 --> 02:25:08,220
nice technology to know it can help you
 

7055
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:10,130
nice technology to know it can help you
out maybe get you jobs that you couldn't

7056
02:25:10,130 --> 02:25:10,140
out maybe get you jobs that you couldn't
 

7057
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:12,230
out maybe get you jobs that you couldn't
get otherwise but it's not something

7058
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:12,240
get otherwise but it's not something
 

7059
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:14,929
get otherwise but it's not something
that I think is mandatory right now all

7060
02:25:14,929 --> 02:25:14,939
that I think is mandatory right now all
 

7061
02:25:14,939 --> 02:25:16,550
that I think is mandatory right now all
right so a big part of web development

7062
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:16,560
right so a big part of web development
 

7063
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:19,070
right so a big part of web development
in general is authentication and

7064
02:25:19,070 --> 02:25:19,080
in general is authentication and
 

7065
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:21,230
in general is authentication and
authorization so for beginners that

7066
02:25:21,230 --> 02:25:21,240
authorization so for beginners that
 

7067
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:22,389
authorization so for beginners that
don't understand the difference

7068
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:22,399
don't understand the difference
 

7069
02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:24,910
don't understand the difference
authentication is the process of

7070
02:25:24,910 --> 02:25:24,920
authentication is the process of
 

7071
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:28,130
authentication is the process of
identifying an individual so a user logs

7072
02:25:28,130 --> 02:25:28,140
identifying an individual so a user logs
 

7073
02:25:28,140 --> 02:25:30,410
identifying an individual so a user logs
in they validate their identity that's

7074
02:25:30,410 --> 02:25:30,420
in they validate their identity that's
 

7075
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:33,230
in they validate their identity that's
authentication authorization pertains to

7076
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:33,240
authentication authorization pertains to
 

7077
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:35,450
authentication authorization pertains to
the permission that that individual has

7078
02:25:35,450 --> 02:25:35,460
the permission that that individual has
 

7079
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:37,670
the permission that that individual has
so just because someone's authenticated

7080
02:25:37,670 --> 02:25:37,680
so just because someone's authenticated
 

7081
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:39,469
so just because someone's authenticated
and logged in doesn't mean that they can

7082
02:25:39,469 --> 02:25:39,479
and logged in doesn't mean that they can
 

7083
02:25:39,479 --> 02:25:41,929
and logged in doesn't mean that they can
do whatever they want and go into like

7084
02:25:41,929 --> 02:25:41,939
do whatever they want and go into like
 

7085
02:25:41,939 --> 02:25:44,270
do whatever they want and go into like
admin areas and start to edit content

7086
02:25:44,270 --> 02:25:44,280
admin areas and start to edit content
 

7087
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:46,429
admin areas and start to edit content
and all that so for that you usually

7088
02:25:46,429 --> 02:25:46,439
and all that so for that you usually
 

7089
02:25:46,439 --> 02:25:48,710
and all that so for that you usually
have some kind of role system with

7090
02:25:48,710 --> 02:25:48,720
have some kind of role system with
 

7091
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:51,590
have some kind of role system with
authorization now as far as how to

7092
02:25:51,590 --> 02:25:51,600
authorization now as far as how to
 

7093
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:53,150
authorization now as far as how to
implement this stuff there's a lot of

7094
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:53,160
implement this stuff there's a lot of
 

7095
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:55,010
implement this stuff there's a lot of
different ways to do it so the

7096
02:25:55,010 --> 02:25:55,020
different ways to do it so the
 

7097
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:58,309
different ways to do it so the
traditional approach is to use sessions

7098
02:25:58,309 --> 02:25:58,319
traditional approach is to use sessions
 

7099
02:25:58,319 --> 02:26:00,170
traditional approach is to use sessions
and cookies this is where the server

7100
02:26:00,170 --> 02:26:00,180
and cookies this is where the server
 

7101
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:02,630
and cookies this is where the server
maintains a session for each user that's

7102
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:02,640
maintains a session for each user that's
 

7103
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:05,570
maintains a session for each user that's
authenticated and stores a session ID in

7104
02:26:05,570 --> 02:26:05,580
authenticated and stores a session ID in
 

7105
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:07,910
authenticated and stores a session ID in
a cookie on the client side and that

7106
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:07,920
a cookie on the client side and that
 

7107
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:10,010
a cookie on the client side and that
session ID is used to retrieve the user

7108
02:26:10,010 --> 02:26:10,020
session ID is used to retrieve the user
 

7109
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:11,690
session ID is used to retrieve the user
information from this server on

7110
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:11,700
information from this server on
 

7111
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:14,690
information from this server on
subsequent requests and it will infer

7112
02:26:14,690 --> 02:26:14,700
subsequent requests and it will infer
 

7113
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:17,809
subsequent requests and it will infer
enforce any authorization rules so if

7114
02:26:17,809 --> 02:26:17,819
enforce any authorization rules so if
 

7115
02:26:17,819 --> 02:26:19,849
enforce any authorization rules so if
you're using a full server-side solution

7116
02:26:19,849 --> 02:26:19,859
you're using a full server-side solution
 

7117
02:26:19,859 --> 02:26:21,710
you're using a full server-side solution
like let's say laravel with blade

7118
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:21,720
like let's say laravel with blade
 

7119
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:23,630
like let's say laravel with blade
templating this is really easy because

7120
02:26:23,630 --> 02:26:23,640
templating this is really easy because
 

7121
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:25,910
templating this is really easy because
the framework and maybe an extra package

7122
02:26:25,910 --> 02:26:25,920
the framework and maybe an extra package
 

7123
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:28,309
the framework and maybe an extra package
or two gives you the the tools that you

7124
02:26:28,309 --> 02:26:28,319
or two gives you the the tools that you
 

7125
02:26:28,319 --> 02:26:31,550
or two gives you the the tools that you
can use to implement this now when we

7126
02:26:31,550 --> 02:26:31,560
can use to implement this now when we
 

7127
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:33,889
can use to implement this now when we
start looking at server I'm sorry single

7128
02:26:33,889 --> 02:26:33,899
start looking at server I'm sorry single
 

7129
02:26:33,899 --> 02:26:37,550
start looking at server I'm sorry single
page applications and having a lot of

7130
02:26:37,550 --> 02:26:37,560
page applications and having a lot of
 

7131
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:39,469
page applications and having a lot of
the app rendered on the client it does

7132
02:26:39,469 --> 02:26:39,479
the app rendered on the client it does
 

7133
02:26:39,479 --> 02:26:41,750
the app rendered on the client it does
get a little bit more difficult and one

7134
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:41,760
get a little bit more difficult and one
 

7135
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:44,690
get a little bit more difficult and one
solution for this is is Json web tokens

7136
02:26:44,690 --> 02:26:44,700
solution for this is is Json web tokens
 

7137
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:47,090
solution for this is is Json web tokens
or token based authentication so

7138
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:47,100
or token based authentication so
 

7139
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:49,250
or token based authentication so
basically we create an endpoint on the

7140
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:49,260
basically we create an endpoint on the
 

7141
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:52,550
basically we create an endpoint on the
back end for the user to authenticate

7142
02:26:52,550 --> 02:26:52,560
back end for the user to authenticate
 

7143
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:55,130
back end for the user to authenticate
with a password and if they pass if they

7144
02:26:55,130 --> 02:26:55,140
with a password and if they pass if they
 

7145
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:57,410
with a password and if they pass if they
validate or authenticate then they get a

7146
02:26:57,410 --> 02:26:57,420
validate or authenticate then they get a
 

7147
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:59,809
validate or authenticate then they get a
token and this is typically a Json web

7148
02:26:59,809 --> 02:26:59,819
token and this is typically a Json web
 

7149
02:26:59,819 --> 02:27:02,570
token and this is typically a Json web
token and usually has the user's ID

7150
02:27:02,570 --> 02:27:02,580
token and usually has the user's ID
 

7151
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:05,150
token and usually has the user's ID
encoded with it and then that gets sent

7152
02:27:05,150 --> 02:27:05,160
encoded with it and then that gets sent
 

7153
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:08,030
encoded with it and then that gets sent
back to the client and then anytime the

7154
02:27:08,030 --> 02:27:08,040
back to the client and then anytime the
 

7155
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:10,190
back to the client and then anytime the
client wants to access a protected route

7156
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:10,200
client wants to access a protected route
 

7157
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:13,010
client wants to access a protected route
they can send that Json web token with

7158
02:27:13,010 --> 02:27:13,020
they can send that Json web token with
 

7159
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:15,349
they can send that Json web token with
the request and then it's validated on

7160
02:27:15,349 --> 02:27:15,359
the request and then it's validated on
 

7161
02:27:15,359 --> 02:27:17,389
the request and then it's validated on
the server okay so that's one way to do

7162
02:27:17,389 --> 02:27:17,399
the server okay so that's one way to do
 

7163
02:27:17,399 --> 02:27:20,330
the server okay so that's one way to do
it now you also have things like you

7164
02:27:20,330 --> 02:27:20,340
it now you also have things like you
 

7165
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:22,250
it now you also have things like you
have oauth which is a simpler solution

7166
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:22,260
have oauth which is a simpler solution
 

7167
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:24,650
have oauth which is a simpler solution
it's an open standard for authentication

7168
02:27:24,650 --> 02:27:24,660
it's an open standard for authentication
 

7169
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:27,110
it's an open standard for authentication
used by many services like Google

7170
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:27,120
used by many services like Google
 

7171
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:30,110
used by many services like Google
Twitter Facebook it allows it allows

7172
02:27:30,110 --> 02:27:30,120
Twitter Facebook it allows it allows
 

7173
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:32,570
Twitter Facebook it allows it allows
users to Grant third-party applications

7174
02:27:32,570 --> 02:27:32,580
users to Grant third-party applications
 

7175
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:35,150
users to Grant third-party applications
access to their data without sharing

7176
02:27:35,150 --> 02:27:35,160
access to their data without sharing
 

7177
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:36,950
access to their data without sharing
their you know their username password

7178
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:36,960
their you know their username password
 

7179
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:39,469
their you know their username password
and any sensitive data so I'm sure

7180
02:27:39,469 --> 02:27:39,479
and any sensitive data so I'm sure
 

7181
02:27:39,479 --> 02:27:41,090
and any sensitive data so I'm sure
you've been on Plenty of websites where

7182
02:27:41,090 --> 02:27:41,100
you've been on Plenty of websites where
 

7183
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:43,309
you've been on Plenty of websites where
you can log in with Google or Facebook

7184
02:27:43,309 --> 02:27:43,319
you can log in with Google or Facebook
 

7185
02:27:43,319 --> 02:27:45,830
you can log in with Google or Facebook
Twitter GitHub so that's that's usually

7186
02:27:45,830 --> 02:27:45,840
Twitter GitHub so that's that's usually
 

7187
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:48,889
Twitter GitHub so that's that's usually
oauth now to make it even easier there

7188
02:27:48,889 --> 02:27:48,899
oauth now to make it even easier there
 

7189
02:27:48,899 --> 02:27:51,050
oauth now to make it even easier there
are third-party services such as auth

7190
02:27:51,050 --> 02:27:51,060
are third-party services such as auth
 

7191
02:27:51,060 --> 02:27:53,750
are third-party services such as auth
zero that use the oauth standard to give

7192
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:53,760
zero that use the oauth standard to give
 

7193
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:56,270
zero that use the oauth standard to give
you an identity management solution that

7194
02:27:56,270 --> 02:27:56,280
you an identity management solution that
 

7195
02:27:56,280 --> 02:27:59,030
you an identity management solution that
provides authentication and provides

7196
02:27:59,030 --> 02:27:59,040
provides authentication and provides
 

7197
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:02,270
provides authentication and provides
user management and security features so

7198
02:28:02,270 --> 02:28:02,280
user management and security features so
 

7199
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:04,370
user management and security features so
with auth zero for example you can

7200
02:28:04,370 --> 02:28:04,380
with auth zero for example you can
 

7201
02:28:04,380 --> 02:28:06,830
with auth zero for example you can
integrate authentication with Google

7202
02:28:06,830 --> 02:28:06,840
integrate authentication with Google
 

7203
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:10,070
integrate authentication with Google
Facebook LinkedIn so it just makes it a

7204
02:28:10,070 --> 02:28:10,080
Facebook LinkedIn so it just makes it a
 

7205
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:12,050
Facebook LinkedIn so it just makes it a
little bit easier and that's probably

7206
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:12,060
little bit easier and that's probably
 

7207
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:14,750
little bit easier and that's probably
what I would recommend starting with so

7208
02:28:14,750 --> 02:28:14,760
what I would recommend starting with so
 

7209
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:17,090
what I would recommend starting with so
chances are you'll have to learn a few

7210
02:28:17,090 --> 02:28:17,100
chances are you'll have to learn a few
 

7211
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:18,770
chances are you'll have to learn a few
different ways to implement this stuff

7212
02:28:18,770 --> 02:28:18,780
different ways to implement this stuff
 

7213
02:28:18,780 --> 02:28:20,990
different ways to implement this stuff
these I would say are the most common

7214
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:21,000
these I would say are the most common
 

7215
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,389
these I would say are the most common
some other things that have to do with

7216
02:28:23,389 --> 02:28:23,399
some other things that have to do with
 

7217
02:28:23,399 --> 02:28:25,670
some other things that have to do with
security and authentication that you'll

7218
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:25,680
security and authentication that you'll
 

7219
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:27,950
security and authentication that you'll
be learning about our password hashing

7220
02:28:27,950 --> 02:28:27,960
be learning about our password hashing
 

7221
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:29,809
be learning about our password hashing
obviously you can't Store Plain text

7222
02:28:29,809 --> 02:28:29,819
obviously you can't Store Plain text
 

7223
02:28:29,819 --> 02:28:32,630
obviously you can't Store Plain text
passwords in a database so they have to

7224
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:32,640
passwords in a database so they have to
 

7225
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:35,090
passwords in a database so they have to
be hashed and you'll probably want to

7226
02:28:35,090 --> 02:28:35,100
be hashed and you'll probably want to
 

7227
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:37,550
be hashed and you'll probably want to
look into two-factor authentication I

7228
02:28:37,550 --> 02:28:37,560
look into two-factor authentication I
 

7229
02:28:37,560 --> 02:28:40,309
look into two-factor authentication I
think that in the future two-factor

7230
02:28:40,309 --> 02:28:40,319
think that in the future two-factor
 

7231
02:28:40,319 --> 02:28:42,290
think that in the future two-factor
authentication is going to be a must on

7232
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:42,300
authentication is going to be a must on
 

7233
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:45,170
authentication is going to be a must on
most websites it kind of is now but I

7234
02:28:45,170 --> 02:28:45,180
most websites it kind of is now but I
 

7235
02:28:45,180 --> 02:28:47,210
most websites it kind of is now but I
think it's gonna it's gonna be even more

7236
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:47,220
think it's gonna it's gonna be even more
 

7237
02:28:47,220 --> 02:28:49,910
think it's gonna it's gonna be even more
common and then protecting routes in

7238
02:28:49,910 --> 02:28:49,920
common and then protecting routes in
 

7239
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,670
common and then protecting routes in
your apis using middleware things like

7240
02:28:52,670 --> 02:28:52,680
your apis using middleware things like
 

7241
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:53,690
your apis using middleware things like
that

7242
02:28:53,690 --> 02:28:53,700
that
 

7243
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:56,389
that
all right so when it comes to deploying

7244
02:28:56,389 --> 02:28:56,399
all right so when it comes to deploying
 

7245
02:28:56,399 --> 02:29:00,530
all right so when it comes to deploying
a full stack project or an API it's a

7246
02:29:00,530 --> 02:29:00,540
a full stack project or an API it's a
 

7247
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:02,090
a full stack project or an API it's a
bit different than deploying a basic

7248
02:29:02,090 --> 02:29:02,100
bit different than deploying a basic
 

7249
02:29:02,100 --> 02:29:05,510
bit different than deploying a basic
front-end website because you you can

7250
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:05,520
front-end website because you you can
 

7251
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:07,190
front-end website because you you can
pretty much host a front-end site

7252
02:29:07,190 --> 02:29:07,200
pretty much host a front-end site
 

7253
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:08,870
pretty much host a front-end site
anywhere it's put on a server it's

7254
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:08,880
anywhere it's put on a server it's
 

7255
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:10,910
anywhere it's put on a server it's
delivered to the client but server-side

7256
02:29:10,910 --> 02:29:10,920
delivered to the client but server-side
 

7257
02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:13,250
delivered to the client but server-side
applications need a server to execute

7258
02:29:13,250 --> 02:29:13,260
applications need a server to execute
 

7259
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:16,309
applications need a server to execute
your code and that code could be in one

7260
02:29:16,309 --> 02:29:16,319
your code and that code could be in one
 

7261
02:29:16,319 --> 02:29:18,710
your code and that code could be in one
or more different programming languages

7262
02:29:18,710 --> 02:29:18,720
or more different programming languages
 

7263
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:21,170
or more different programming languages
so there's two main categories when it

7264
02:29:21,170 --> 02:29:21,180
so there's two main categories when it
 

7265
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:23,330
so there's two main categories when it
comes to these Services you have a pass

7266
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:23,340
comes to these Services you have a pass
 

7267
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:26,389
comes to these Services you have a pass
which is a platform as a service and

7268
02:29:26,389 --> 02:29:26,399
which is a platform as a service and
 

7269
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:28,550
which is a platform as a service and
this is where pretty much everything is

7270
02:29:28,550 --> 02:29:28,560
this is where pretty much everything is
 

7271
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:30,710
this is where pretty much everything is
done for you you don't have to provision

7272
02:29:30,710 --> 02:29:30,720
done for you you don't have to provision
 

7273
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:33,650
done for you you don't have to provision
a server install nginx and firewalls and

7274
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:33,660
a server install nginx and firewalls and
 

7275
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:35,690
a server install nginx and firewalls and
all that all you really have to do is

7276
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:35,700
all that all you really have to do is
 

7277
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:37,490
all that all you really have to do is
push your code to something like GitHub

7278
02:29:37,490 --> 02:29:37,500
push your code to something like GitHub
 

7279
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:40,309
push your code to something like GitHub
and then select the repo from within the

7280
02:29:40,309 --> 02:29:40,319
and then select the repo from within the
 

7281
02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:42,469
and then select the repo from within the
platform much like you do with netlify

7282
02:29:42,469 --> 02:29:42,479
platform much like you do with netlify
 

7283
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:45,830
platform much like you do with netlify
or versl so then you have unmanaged

7284
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:45,840
or versl so then you have unmanaged
 

7285
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:48,349
or versl so then you have unmanaged
Cloud hosting which is where you

7286
02:29:48,349 --> 02:29:48,359
Cloud hosting which is where you
 

7287
02:29:48,359 --> 02:29:51,230
Cloud hosting which is where you
essentially rent out a Linux box and you

7288
02:29:51,230 --> 02:29:51,240
essentially rent out a Linux box and you
 

7289
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:53,090
essentially rent out a Linux box and you
can install whatever you want on it any

7290
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:53,100
can install whatever you want on it any
 

7291
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:56,210
can install whatever you want on it any
Linux disk draw any programs you want

7292
02:29:56,210 --> 02:29:56,220
Linux disk draw any programs you want
 

7293
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:58,429
Linux disk draw any programs you want
whatever you set up nginx and your web

7294
02:29:58,429 --> 02:29:58,439
whatever you set up nginx and your web
 

7295
02:29:58,439 --> 02:30:00,770
whatever you set up nginx and your web
servers and all that but of course

7296
02:30:00,770 --> 02:30:00,780
servers and all that but of course
 

7297
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:03,830
servers and all that but of course
that's much more difficult so I'll start

7298
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:03,840
that's much more difficult so I'll start
 

7299
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:06,710
that's much more difficult so I'll start
with the platforms as a service so

7300
02:30:06,710 --> 02:30:06,720
with the platforms as a service so
 

7301
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:10,010
with the platforms as a service so
render.com is what I would suggest using

7302
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:10,020
render.com is what I would suggest using
 

7303
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:14,450
render.com is what I would suggest using
it's super easy you can host node.js

7304
02:30:14,450 --> 02:30:14,460
it's super easy you can host node.js
 

7305
02:30:14,460 --> 02:30:17,750
it's super easy you can host node.js
python Ruby Rost golang just about any

python Ruby Rost golang just about any
 

7307
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:21,290
python Ruby Rost golang just about any
modern programming language and it's

7308
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:21,300
modern programming language and it's
 

7309
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:23,510
modern programming language and it's
simple to deploy it's it's very similar

7310
02:30:23,510 --> 02:30:23,520
simple to deploy it's it's very similar
 

7311
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:26,570
simple to deploy it's it's very similar

PHP nginx is a more modern web server

7474
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:48,780
PHP nginx is a more modern web server
 

7475
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:50,990
PHP nginx is a more modern web server
designed for high performance and

7476
02:33:50,990 --> 02:33:51,000
designed for high performance and
 

7477
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,929
designed for high performance and
scalability and it's used a lot for

7478
02:33:53,929 --> 02:33:53,939
scalability and it's used a lot for
 

7479
02:33:53,939 --> 02:33:56,450
scalability and it's used a lot for
modern application and microservice

7480
02:33:56,450 --> 02:33:56,460
modern application and microservice
 

7481
02:33:56,460 --> 02:33:58,610
modern application and microservice
architectures so having a basic

7482
02:33:58,610 --> 02:33:58,620
architectures so having a basic
 

7483
02:33:58,620 --> 02:34:01,309
architectures so having a basic
understanding of how these work and also

7484
02:34:01,309 --> 02:34:01,319
understanding of how these work and also
 

7485
02:34:01,319 --> 02:34:04,070
understanding of how these work and also
some of the the major config files is

7486
02:34:04,070 --> 02:34:04,080
some of the the major config files is
 

7487
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:06,950
some of the the major config files is
definitely a plus now another technology

7488
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:06,960
definitely a plus now another technology

02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:08,690
definitely a plus now another technology
you may get into especially if you're

7490
02:34:08,690 --> 02:34:08,700
you may get into especially if you're
 

7491
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:11,389
you may get into especially if you're
getting into devops is containerization

7492
02:34:11,389 --> 02:34:11,399
getting into devops is containerization
 

7493
02:34:11,399 --> 02:34:13,370
getting into devops is containerization
so this is where you package your

7494
02:34:13,370 --> 02:34:13,380
so this is where you package your
 

7495
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:16,429
so this is where you package your
project and its environment in in any

7496
02:34:16,429 --> 02:34:16,439
project and its environment in in any
 

7497
02:34:16,439 --> 02:34:19,010
project and its environment in in any
dependencies it has including server

7498
02:34:19,010 --> 02:34:19,020
dependencies it has including server
 

7499
02:34:19,020 --> 02:34:21,170
dependencies it has including server
software databases languages and

7500
02:34:21,170 --> 02:34:21,180
software databases languages and
 

7501
02:34:21,180 --> 02:34:23,150
software databases languages and
anything else into what are called

7502
02:34:23,150 --> 02:34:23,160
anything else into what are called
 

7503
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:26,450
anything else into what are called
containers and then your container can

7504
02:34:26,450 --> 02:34:26,460
containers and then your container can
 

7505
02:34:26,460 --> 02:34:28,969
containers and then your container can
run on any machine and it will run the

7506
02:34:28,969 --> 02:34:28,979
run on any machine and it will run the
 

7507
02:34:28,979 --> 02:34:31,490
run on any machine and it will run the
same exact way because it's running in

7508
02:34:31,490 --> 02:34:31,500
same exact way because it's running in
 

7509
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:33,170
same exact way because it's running in
the contained environment which is going

7510
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:33,180
the contained environment which is going
 

7511
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:35,870
the contained environment which is going
to be the same on every machine so this

7512
02:34:35,870 --> 02:34:35,880
to be the same on every machine so this
 

7513
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,910
to be the same on every machine so this
is very beneficial if you're on a team

7514
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:37,920
is very beneficial if you're on a team
 

7515
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:40,370
is very beneficial if you're on a team
and you have projects that have to run

7516
02:34:40,370 --> 02:34:40,380
and you have projects that have to run
 

7517
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:42,830
and you have projects that have to run
on multiple machines and Docker is

7518
02:34:42,830 --> 02:34:42,840
on multiple machines and Docker is
 

7519
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:44,690
on multiple machines and Docker is
definitely the the containerization

7520
02:34:44,690 --> 02:34:44,700
definitely the the containerization
 

7521
02:34:44,700 --> 02:34:46,610
definitely the the containerization
platform that you're going to most

7522
02:34:46,610 --> 02:34:46,620
platform that you're going to most
 

7523
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:49,370
platform that you're going to most
likely be run into if if this is

7524
02:34:49,370 --> 02:34:49,380
likely be run into if if this is
 

7525
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:51,230
likely be run into if if this is
something that you're going to do there

7526
02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:51,240
something that you're going to do there
 

7527
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:53,630
something that you're going to do there
are some others like vagrant but Docker

7528
02:34:53,630 --> 02:34:53,640
are some others like vagrant but Docker
 

7529
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:56,090
are some others like vagrant but Docker
has really shined in this area and then

7530
02:34:56,090 --> 02:34:56,100
has really shined in this area and then
 

7531
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:58,670
has really shined in this area and then
you have kubernetes which you can use to

7532
02:34:58,670 --> 02:34:58,680
you have kubernetes which you can use to
 

7533
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,770
you have kubernetes which you can use to
manage your containers now if you're a

7534
02:35:00,770 --> 02:35:00,780
manage your containers now if you're a
 

7535
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:02,990
manage your containers now if you're a
beginner or a freelancer or someone that

7536
02:35:02,990 --> 02:35:03,000
beginner or a freelancer or someone that
 

7537
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,849
beginner or a freelancer or someone that
mostly works by yourself I don't think

7538
02:35:04,849 --> 02:35:04,859
mostly works by yourself I don't think
 

7539
02:35:04,859 --> 02:35:06,650
mostly works by yourself I don't think
you need to get into Docker or anything

7540
02:35:06,650 --> 02:35:06,660
you need to get into Docker or anything
 

7541
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:08,389
you need to get into Docker or anything
like that but it is great for

7542
02:35:08,389 --> 02:35:08,399
like that but it is great for
 

7543
02:35:08,399 --> 02:35:11,090
like that but it is great for
collaboration where your development

7544
02:35:11,090 --> 02:35:11,100
collaboration where your development
 

7545
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:13,670
collaboration where your development
environment has to be a certain way on

7546
02:35:13,670 --> 02:35:13,680
environment has to be a certain way on
 

7547
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:15,410
environment has to be a certain way on
multiple machines

7548
02:35:15,410 --> 02:35:15,420
multiple machines
 

7549
02:35:15,420 --> 02:35:18,530
multiple machines
all right so you're going to have assets

7550
02:35:18,530 --> 02:35:18,540
all right so you're going to have assets
 

7551
02:35:18,540 --> 02:35:22,130
all right so you're going to have assets
like images documents videos Etc where

7552
02:35:22,130 --> 02:35:22,140
like images documents videos Etc where
 

7553
02:35:22,140 --> 02:35:23,990
like images documents videos Etc where
you need to store them somewhere and

7554
02:35:23,990 --> 02:35:24,000
you need to store them somewhere and
 

7555
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:25,550
you need to store them somewhere and
you're not going to use GitHub to store

7556
02:35:25,550 --> 02:35:25,560
you're not going to use GitHub to store
 

7557
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:27,950
you're not going to use GitHub to store
hundreds or thousands of images so

7558
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:27,960
hundreds or thousands of images so
 

7559
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:29,570
hundreds or thousands of images so
there's all kinds of services for stuff

7560
02:35:29,570 --> 02:35:29,580
there's all kinds of services for stuff
 

7561
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:32,510
there's all kinds of services for stuff
like that I really like cloudinary it

7562
02:35:32,510 --> 02:35:32,520
like that I really like cloudinary it
 

7563
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:34,849
like that I really like cloudinary it
stores your media but it also optimizes

7564
02:35:34,849 --> 02:35:34,859
stores your media but it also optimizes
 

7565
02:35:34,859 --> 02:35:37,730
stores your media but it also optimizes
it it creates multiple versions of it so

7566
02:35:37,730 --> 02:35:37,740
it it creates multiple versions of it so
 

7567
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:39,530
it it creates multiple versions of it so
you may have a large version for

7568
02:35:39,530 --> 02:35:39,540
you may have a large version for
 

7569
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:42,050
you may have a large version for
desktops large image and smaller

7570
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:42,060
desktops large image and smaller
 

7571
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:44,690
desktops large image and smaller
versions for tablets and smartphones and

7572
02:35:44,690 --> 02:35:44,700
versions for tablets and smartphones and
 

7573
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:47,450
versions for tablets and smartphones and
you get a nice API with all the image

7574
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:47,460
you get a nice API with all the image
 

7575
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:49,610
you get a nice API with all the image
URLs so you can integrate that into

7576
02:35:49,610 --> 02:35:49,620
URLs so you can integrate that into
 

7577
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:52,250
URLs so you can integrate that into
different platforms really easily in

7578
02:35:52,250 --> 02:35:52,260
different platforms really easily in
 

7579
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:54,469
different platforms really easily in
fact in my next JS course we integrate

7580
02:35:54,469 --> 02:35:54,479
fact in my next JS course we integrate
 

7581
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:57,770
fact in my next JS course we integrate
Cloud Nary into the strappy headless CMS

7582
02:35:57,770 --> 02:35:57,780
Cloud Nary into the strappy headless CMS
 

7583
02:35:57,780 --> 02:36:01,250
Cloud Nary into the strappy headless CMS
so Amazon S3 is a storage service that's

7584
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:01,260
so Amazon S3 is a storage service that's
 

7585
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:04,849
so Amazon S3 is a storage service that's
part of Amazon web services probably the

7586
02:36:04,849 --> 02:36:04,859
part of Amazon web services probably the
 

7587
02:36:04,859 --> 02:36:07,250
part of Amazon web services probably the
only part of it that I use and you can

7588
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:07,260
only part of it that I use and you can
 

7589
02:36:07,260 --> 02:36:09,290
only part of it that I use and you can
use that to integrate into your projects

7590
02:36:09,290 --> 02:36:09,300
use that to integrate into your projects
 

7591
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:11,450
use that to integrate into your projects
pretty easily as well and there's all

7592
02:36:11,450 --> 02:36:11,460
pretty easily as well and there's all
 

7593
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:13,370
pretty easily as well and there's all
kinds of libraries for node.js or

7594
02:36:13,370 --> 02:36:13,380
kinds of libraries for node.js or
 

7595
02:36:13,380 --> 02:36:15,349
kinds of libraries for node.js or
whatever you're using now the last two

7596
02:36:15,349 --> 02:36:15,359
whatever you're using now the last two
 

7597

for continuous integration and

7600
02:36:20,090 --> 02:36:20,100
for continuous integration and
 

7601
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:22,370
for continuous integration and
continuous deployment and this is more

7602
02:36:22,370 --> 02:36:22,380
continuous deployment and this is more
 

7603
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:25,130
continuous deployment and this is more
towards the devops side of things so it

7604
02:36:25,130 --> 02:36:25,140
towards the devops side of things so it
 

7605
02:36:25,140 --> 02:36:26,990
towards the devops side of things so it
involves continuously merging and

7606
02:36:26,990 --> 02:36:27,000
involves continuously merging and
 

7607
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,150
involves continuously merging and
testing code changes from multiple

7608
02:36:29,150 --> 02:36:29,160
testing code changes from multiple
 

7609
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:31,870
testing code changes from multiple
developers into a shared code repository

7610

developers into a shared code repository
 

7611
02:36:31,880 --> 02:36:36,230
developers into a shared code repository
so it's it's more to ensure that code

7612
02:36:36,230 --> 02:36:36,240
so it's it's more to ensure that code
 

7613
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:39,590
so it's it's more to ensure that code
changes are compatible and they can be

7614
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:39,600
changes are compatible and they can be
 

7615
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:41,570
changes are compatible and they can be
integrated into the code base without

02:36:41,570 --> 02:36:41,580
integrated into the code base without
 

7617
02:36:41,580 --> 02:36:44,090
integrated into the code base without
causing issues and there's tools to help

7618
02:36:44,090 --> 02:36:44,100
causing issues and there's tools to help
 

7619
02:36:44,100 --> 02:36:46,969
causing issues and there's tools to help
with this like Jenkins Travis CI Circle

02:37:02,090 --> 02:37:02,100
maintaining infrastructure as code using
 

7633
02:37:02,100 --> 02:37:05,030

palumi all right so we've gone over a

7636
02:37:08,030 --> 02:37:08,040
palumi all right so we've gone over a
 

7637
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:10,070
palumi all right so we've gone over a
ton and I'm sure that some of you are

7638
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:10,080
ton and I'm sure that some of you are
 

7639
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:12,349
ton and I'm sure that some of you are
overwhelmed just know that you only have

7640
02:37:12,349 --> 02:37:12,359
overwhelmed just know that you only have
 

7641
02:37:12,359 --> 02:37:14,330
overwhelmed just know that you only have
to learn a very small portion of what

7642
02:37:14,330 --> 02:37:14,340
to learn a very small portion of what
 

7643
02:37:14,340 --> 02:37:15,830
to learn a very small portion of what
we've talked about and the the reason

7644
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:15,840
we've talked about and the the reason
 

7645
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:18,410
we've talked about and the the reason
that I mentioned so much in these these

7646
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:18,420
that I mentioned so much in these these
 

7647
02:37:18,420 --> 02:37:20,990
that I mentioned so much in these these
guides is to show you all of the options

7648
02:37:20,990 --> 02:37:21,000
guides is to show you all of the options
 

7649

a lot of people on YouTube they'll

7650
02:37:23,210 --> 02:37:23,220
a lot of people on YouTube they'll
 

7651
02:37:23,220 --> 02:37:24,590
a lot of people on YouTube they'll
they'll have you think that the only

7652
02:37:24,590 --> 02:37:24,600
they'll have you think that the only
 

7653
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:26,570
they'll have you think that the only
thing out there is like JavaScript and

7654
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:26,580
thing out there is like JavaScript and
 

7655
02:37:26,580 --> 02:37:28,429
thing out there is like JavaScript and
being a merge stack developer but

7656
02:37:28,429 --> 02:37:28,439
being a merge stack developer but
 

7657
02:37:28,439 --> 02:37:30,469
being a merge stack developer but
there's a lot more out there and you'll

7658
02:37:30,469 --> 02:37:30,479
there's a lot more out there and you'll
 

7659
02:37:30,479 --> 02:37:32,389
there's a lot more out there and you'll
find out when you start looking for jobs

7660
02:37:32,389 --> 02:37:32,399
find out when you start looking for jobs
 

7661
02:37:32,399 --> 02:37:34,670
find out when you start looking for jobs
so we talked about a lot but as far as

7662
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:34,680
so we talked about a lot but as far as
 

7663
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:36,349
so we talked about a lot but as far as
what you absolutely need to know you

7664
02:37:36,349 --> 02:37:36,359
what you absolutely need to know you
 

7665
02:37:36,359 --> 02:37:38,809
what you absolutely need to know you
need to know a server-side programming

7666
02:37:38,809 --> 02:37:38,819
need to know a server-side programming
 

7667
02:37:38,819 --> 02:37:41,570
need to know a server-side programming
language or technology obviously node.js

7668
02:37:41,570 --> 02:37:41,580
language or technology obviously node.js
 

7669
02:37:41,580 --> 02:37:43,730
language or technology obviously node.js
is not a language but it's a server-side

7670
02:37:43,730 --> 02:37:43,740
is not a language but it's a server-side
 

7671
02:37:43,740 --> 02:37:45,590
is not a language but it's a server-side
technology so you're fine with that

7672
02:37:45,590 --> 02:37:45,600
technology so you're fine with that
 

7673
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:47,690
technology so you're fine with that
you're fine with just about any other

7674
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:47,700
you're fine with just about any other
 

7675
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:50,030
you're fine with just about any other
language especially the languages that

7676
02:37:50,030 --> 02:37:50,040
language especially the languages that
 

7677
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:52,309
language especially the languages that
we talked about you definitely want to

7678
02:37:52,309 --> 02:37:52,319
we talked about you definitely want to
 

7679
02:37:52,319 --> 02:37:55,790
we talked about you definitely want to
look around in your area and see what's

7680
02:37:55,790 --> 02:37:55,800
look around in your area and see what's
 

7681
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:58,010
look around in your area and see what's
really popular in terms of the the jobs

7682
02:37:58,010 --> 02:37:58,020
really popular in terms of the the jobs
 

7683
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:00,530
really popular in terms of the the jobs
that are offered all right so a language

7684
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:00,540
that are offered all right so a language
 

7685
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:02,330
that are offered all right so a language
a framework so you want to know a

7686
02:38:02,330 --> 02:38:02,340
a framework so you want to know a
 

7687
02:38:02,340 --> 02:38:04,070
a framework so you want to know a
server-side framework in that language

7688
02:38:04,070 --> 02:38:04,080
server-side framework in that language
 

7689
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:06,170
server-side framework in that language
the fact is you're just good you're

7690
02:38:06,170 --> 02:38:06,180
the fact is you're just good you're
 

7691
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:07,730
the fact is you're just good you're
going to be using a framework why

7692
02:38:07,730 --> 02:38:07,740
going to be using a framework why
 

7693
02:38:07,740 --> 02:38:09,530
going to be using a framework why
reinvent the wheel you're not going to

7694
02:38:09,530 --> 02:38:09,540
reinvent the wheel you're not going to
 

7695
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:11,690
reinvent the wheel you're not going to
just do everything from scratch so

7696
02:38:11,690 --> 02:38:11,700
just do everything from scratch so
 

7697
02:38:11,700 --> 02:38:14,150
just do everything from scratch so
Frameworks are they make things a lot

7698
02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:14,160
Frameworks are they make things a lot
 

7699
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,090
Frameworks are they make things a lot
easier and there more secure than if you

7700
02:38:17,090 --> 02:38:17,100
easier and there more secure than if you
 

7701
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:19,670
easier and there more secure than if you
were to just use vanilla code and

7702
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:19,680
were to just use vanilla code and
 

7703
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:21,650
were to just use vanilla code and
there's a lot of a lot of advantages to

7704
02:38:21,650 --> 02:38:21,660
there's a lot of a lot of advantages to
 

7705
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:25,730
there's a lot of a lot of advantages to
it so databases and orms so you should

7706
02:38:25,730 --> 02:38:25,740
it so databases and orms so you should
 

7707
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:27,590
it so databases and orms so you should
have some experience with either a

7708
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:27,600
have some experience with either a
 

7709
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:30,710
have some experience with either a
relational or mySQL database even

7710
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:30,720
relational or mySQL database even
 

7711
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:32,690
relational or mySQL database even
something like Firebase or Super Bass

7712
02:38:32,690 --> 02:38:32,700
something like Firebase or Super Bass
 

7713
02:38:32,700 --> 02:38:34,790
something like Firebase or Super Bass
you should know how to implement that

7714
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:34,800
you should know how to implement that
 

7715
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:36,710
you should know how to implement that
database within your code including

7716
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:36,720
database within your code including
 

7717
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:39,590
database within your code including
connecting and querying it okay you

7718
02:38:39,590 --> 02:38:39,600
connecting and querying it okay you
 

7719
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:41,630
connecting and querying it okay you
should probably know at least the basics

7720
02:38:41,630 --> 02:38:41,640
should probably know at least the basics
 

7721
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:44,570
should probably know at least the basics
of SQL structured query language if

7722
02:38:44,570 --> 02:38:44,580
of SQL structured query language if
 

7723
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:46,210
of SQL structured query language if
you're using a relational database

7724
02:38:46,210 --> 02:38:46,220
you're using a relational database
 

7725
02:38:46,220 --> 02:38:48,590
you're using a relational database
you're probably going to learn some kind

7726
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:48,600
you're probably going to learn some kind
 

7727
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:50,990
you're probably going to learn some kind
of orm to use within your code something

7728
02:38:50,990 --> 02:38:51,000
of orm to use within your code something
 

7729
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:55,610
of orm to use within your code something
like like sqlize or mongoose or or SQL

7730
02:38:55,610 --> 02:38:55,620
like like sqlize or mongoose or or SQL
 

7731
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:57,530
like like sqlize or mongoose or or SQL
Alchemy something like that so you're

7732
02:38:57,530 --> 02:38:57,540
Alchemy something like that so you're
 

7733
02:38:57,540 --> 02:39:00,889
Alchemy something like that so you're
not writing raw SQL queries

7734
02:39:00,889 --> 02:39:00,899
not writing raw SQL queries
 

7735
02:39:00,899 --> 02:39:02,389
not writing raw SQL queries
so you should be friendly with the

7736
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:02,399
so you should be friendly with the
 

7737
02:39:02,399 --> 02:39:04,610
so you should be friendly with the
terminal as a full stack developer you

7738
02:39:04,610 --> 02:39:04,620
terminal as a full stack developer you
 

7739
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:06,050
terminal as a full stack developer you
should be able to navigate your system

7740

02:39:13,130 --> 02:39:13,140
you know Unix based commands so rest
 

7745
02:39:13,140 --> 02:39:16,790
you know Unix based commands so rest
apis you should fully understand HTTP

7746
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:16,800
apis you should fully understand HTTP
 

7747

requests the whole request response
 

7749
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:21,950
requests the whole request response
cycle how to create rest apis you should

7750
02:39:21,950 --> 02:39:21,960
cycle how to create rest apis you should
 

7751
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:23,510
cycle how to create rest apis you should
also be familiar with authentication

7752

web tokens or something like oauth and

7756
02:39:30,290 --> 02:39:30,300
web tokens or something like oauth and
 

7757
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:32,630
web tokens or something like oauth and
then you don't have to know all the

7758
02:39:32,630 --> 02:39:32,640
then you don't have to know all the
 

7759
02:39:32,640 --> 02:39:34,610
then you don't have to know all the
devops stuff we talked about I certainly

7760
02:39:34,610 --> 02:39:34,620
devops stuff we talked about I certainly
 

7761
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:38,030
devops stuff we talked about I certainly
don't you don't need to know Docker or

7762
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:38,040
don't you don't need to know Docker or
 

7763
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:40,849
don't you don't need to know Docker or
anything like that it is helpful but you

7764
02:39:40,849 --> 02:39:40,859
anything like that it is helpful but you
 

7765
02:39:40,859 --> 02:39:42,290
anything like that it is helpful but you
should at least know how to deploy your

7766
02:39:42,290 --> 02:39:42,300
should at least know how to deploy your
 

7767
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:44,570
should at least know how to deploy your
projects to production and create an

7768
02:39:44,570 --> 02:39:44,580
projects to production and create an
 

7769
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:47,210
projects to production and create an
environment for continuous deployment so

7770
02:39:47,210 --> 02:39:47,220
environment for continuous deployment so
 

7771
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:48,830
environment for continuous deployment so
those are pretty much the bottom lines

7772
02:39:48,830 --> 02:39:48,840
those are pretty much the bottom lines
 

7773
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:51,889
those are pretty much the bottom lines
for being either a back end or a full

stack developer obviously with full
 

7777
02:39:53,460 --> 02:39:55,309
stack developer obviously with full
stack you need the front end stuff we've

7778
02:39:55,309 --> 02:39:55,319

7779
02:39:55,319 --> 02:39:57,050
stack you need the front end stuff we've
already talked about

7780
02:39:57,050 --> 02:39:57,060
already talked about
 

7781
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:59,270
already talked about
okay so even though this is a web dev

7782
02:39:59,270 --> 02:39:59,280
okay so even though this is a web dev
 

7783
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,849
okay so even though this is a web dev
guide there's web technologies that can

7784
02:40:01,849 --> 02:40:01,859
guide there's web technologies that can
 

7785
02:40:01,859 --> 02:40:04,969
guide there's web technologies that can
be used for other things such as mobile

7786
02:40:04,969 --> 02:40:04,979
be used for other things such as mobile
 

7787
02:40:04,979 --> 02:40:07,670
be used for other things such as mobile
development if you strictly want to be

7788
02:40:07,670 --> 02:40:07,680
development if you strictly want to be
 

7789
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:10,550
development if you strictly want to be
into Mobile development then you might

7790
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:10,560
into Mobile development then you might
 

7791
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:13,070
into Mobile development then you might
learn something like Swift for iOS or

7792
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:13,080
learn something like Swift for iOS or
 

7793
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:15,710
learn something like Swift for iOS or
kotlin for Android apps but we do have

7794
02:40:15,710 --> 02:40:15,720
kotlin for Android apps but we do have
 

7795
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:18,410
kotlin for Android apps but we do have
web technologies that allow you to

7796
02:40:18,410 --> 02:40:18,420
web technologies that allow you to
 

7797
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:20,630
web technologies that allow you to
create cross-platform apps that you can

7798
02:40:20,630 --> 02:40:20,640
create cross-platform apps that you can
 

7799
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:24,290
create cross-platform apps that you can
run on both IOS and Android so react

7800
02:40:24,290 --> 02:40:24,300
run on both IOS and Android so react
 

7801
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:26,450
run on both IOS and Android so react
native is obviously a popular choice if

7802
02:40:26,450 --> 02:40:26,460
native is obviously a popular choice if
 

7803
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:28,849
native is obviously a popular choice if
you're already familiar with react react

7804
02:40:28,849 --> 02:40:28,859
you're already familiar with react react
 

7805
02:40:28,859 --> 02:40:31,969
you're already familiar with react react
is a UI library and when we use it to

7806
02:40:31,969 --> 02:40:31,979
is a UI library and when we use it to
 

7807
02:40:31,979 --> 02:40:34,130
is a UI library and when we use it to
build web apps we use it along with a

7808
02:40:34,130 --> 02:40:34,140
build web apps we use it along with a
 

7809
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:37,190
build web apps we use it along with a
library called react Dom so if you're

7810
02:40:37,190 --> 02:40:37,200
library called react Dom so if you're
 

7811
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:39,110
library called react Dom so if you're
building a mobile app with react then

7812
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:39,120
building a mobile app with react then
 

7813
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:40,370
building a mobile app with react then
you're just not going to include the

7814
02:40:40,370 --> 02:40:40,380
you're just not going to include the
 

7815
02:40:40,380 --> 02:40:42,770
you're just not going to include the
react Dom Library instead you'll include

7816
02:40:42,770 --> 02:40:42,780
react Dom Library instead you'll include
 

7817
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:45,170
react Dom Library instead you'll include
react native so you still have the

7818
02:40:45,170 --> 02:40:45,180
react native so you still have the
 

7819
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:47,750
react native so you still have the
structure of components and state and

7820
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:47,760
structure of components and state and
 

7821
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:49,550
structure of components and state and
you get some added things as well

7822
02:40:49,550 --> 02:40:49,560
you get some added things as well
 

7823
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:51,070
you get some added things as well
obviously

7824
02:40:51,070 --> 02:40:51,080
obviously
 

7825
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:53,630
obviously
but when you build a react native

7826
02:40:53,630 --> 02:40:53,640
but when you build a react native
 

7827
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:55,610
but when you build a react native
application it's going to run on both

7828
02:40:55,610 --> 02:40:55,620
application it's going to run on both
 

7829
02:40:55,620 --> 02:40:59,030
application it's going to run on both
iOS and Android and that that's a huge

7830
02:40:59,030 --> 02:40:59,040
iOS and Android and that that's a huge
 

7831
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:01,190
iOS and Android and that that's a huge
Advantage because if you're using let's

7832
02:41:01,190 --> 02:41:01,200
Advantage because if you're using let's
 

7833
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:03,410
Advantage because if you're using let's
say Swift to create a mobile app it's

7834
02:41:03,410 --> 02:41:03,420
say Swift to create a mobile app it's
 

7835
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:05,570
say Swift to create a mobile app it's
only going to be on iOS if you want that

7836
02:41:05,570 --> 02:41:05,580
only going to be on iOS if you want that
 

7837
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:07,790
only going to be on iOS if you want that
same application to run on Android

7838
02:41:07,790 --> 02:41:07,800
same application to run on Android
 

7839
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:09,410
same application to run on Android
you're basically building a whole

7840
02:41:09,410 --> 02:41:09,420
you're basically building a whole
 

7841
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:12,590
you're basically building a whole
separate app using Java or kotlin so

7842
02:41:12,590 --> 02:41:12,600
separate app using Java or kotlin so
 

7843
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:14,570
separate app using Java or kotlin so
with these Technologies you have one

7844
02:41:14,570 --> 02:41:14,580
with these Technologies you have one
 

7845
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:16,550
with these Technologies you have one
single code base you might have some

7846
02:41:16,550 --> 02:41:16,560
single code base you might have some
 

7847
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:18,710
single code base you might have some
configuration to change around for each

7848
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:18,720
configuration to change around for each
 

7849
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:20,990
configuration to change around for each
platform but that's about it you still

7850
02:41:20,990 --> 02:41:21,000
platform but that's about it you still
 

7851
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,870
platform but that's about it you still
have one single code base which is huge

7852
02:41:23,870 --> 02:41:23,880
have one single code base which is huge
 

7853
02:41:23,880 --> 02:41:26,330
have one single code base which is huge
all right so flutter is another

7854
02:41:26,330 --> 02:41:26,340
all right so flutter is another
 

7855
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:28,309
all right so flutter is another
cross-platform mobile framework by

7856
02:41:28,309 --> 02:41:28,319
cross-platform mobile framework by
 

7857
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:30,710
cross-platform mobile framework by
Google and flutter doesn't actually use

7858
02:41:30,710 --> 02:41:30,720
Google and flutter doesn't actually use
 

7859
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:32,510
Google and flutter doesn't actually use
JavaScript it uses a language called

7860
02:41:32,510 --> 02:41:32,520
JavaScript it uses a language called
 

7861
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:35,090
JavaScript it uses a language called
Dart which is very similar to JavaScript

7862
02:41:35,090 --> 02:41:35,100
Dart which is very similar to JavaScript
 

7863
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:37,250
Dart which is very similar to JavaScript
so a lot of JavaScript developers do

7864
02:41:37,250 --> 02:41:37,260
so a lot of JavaScript developers do
 

7865
02:41:37,260 --> 02:41:40,429
so a lot of JavaScript developers do
actually go into learning flutter and

7866
02:41:40,429 --> 02:41:40,439
actually go into learning flutter and
 

7867
02:41:40,439 --> 02:41:43,010
actually go into learning flutter and
flutter is it's a bit faster than react

7868
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:43,020
flutter is it's a bit faster than react
 

7869
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:45,950
flutter is it's a bit faster than react
native because it doesn't have that

7870
02:41:45,950 --> 02:41:45,960
native because it doesn't have that
 

7871
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:48,530
native because it doesn't have that
extra step of having the react native

7872
02:41:48,530 --> 02:41:48,540
extra step of having the react native
 

7873
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:51,650
extra step of having the react native
Bridge flutter code actually compiles to

7874
02:41:51,650 --> 02:41:51,660
Bridge flutter code actually compiles to
 

7875
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:54,950
Bridge flutter code actually compiles to
arm or Intel machine code as well as

7876
02:41:54,950 --> 02:41:54,960
arm or Intel machine code as well as
 

7877
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:58,070
arm or Intel machine code as well as
JavaScript for for fast performance on

7878
02:41:58,070 --> 02:41:58,080
JavaScript for for fast performance on
 

7879
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,270
JavaScript for for fast performance on
any device

7880
02:41:59,270 --> 02:41:59,280
any device
 

7881
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:01,610
any device
now ionic is a framework that's been

7882
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:01,620
now ionic is a framework that's been
 

7883
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:03,050
now ionic is a framework that's been
around for a while and you could build

7884
02:42:03,050 --> 02:42:03,060
around for a while and you could build
 

7885
02:42:03,060 --> 02:42:05,389
around for a while and you could build
hybrid apps and Progressive web apps

7886
02:42:05,389 --> 02:42:05,399
hybrid apps and Progressive web apps
 

7887
02:42:05,399 --> 02:42:08,210
hybrid apps and Progressive web apps
with it and I'll talk about pwas in a

7888
02:42:08,210 --> 02:42:08,220
with it and I'll talk about pwas in a
 

7889
02:42:08,220 --> 02:42:10,730
with it and I'll talk about pwas in a
minute so ionic isn't going to be as

7890
02:42:10,730 --> 02:42:10,740
minute so ionic isn't going to be as
 

7891
02:42:10,740 --> 02:42:12,650
minute so ionic isn't going to be as
performant as react native or flutter

7892
02:42:12,650 --> 02:42:12,660
performant as react native or flutter
 

7893
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:15,230
performant as react native or flutter
but you're also not bound to any

7894
02:42:15,230 --> 02:42:15,240
but you're also not bound to any
 

7895
02:42:15,240 --> 02:42:17,330
but you're also not bound to any
specific framework you can basically do

7896
02:42:17,330 --> 02:42:17,340
specific framework you can basically do
 

7897
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:19,429
specific framework you can basically do
whatever you want you can use react view

7898
02:42:19,429 --> 02:42:19,439
whatever you want you can use react view
 

7899
02:42:19,439 --> 02:42:22,849
whatever you want you can use react view
angular Etc all right and ionic apps are

7900
02:42:22,849 --> 02:42:22,859
angular Etc all right and ionic apps are
 

7901
02:42:22,859 --> 02:42:25,790
angular Etc all right and ionic apps are
also cross-platform now we also have

7902
02:42:25,790 --> 02:42:25,800
also cross-platform now we also have
 

7903
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:28,309
also cross-platform now we also have
xamarin which is a c-sharp framework for

7904
02:42:28,309 --> 02:42:28,319
xamarin which is a c-sharp framework for
 

7905
02:42:28,319 --> 02:42:31,309
xamarin which is a c-sharp framework for
building mobile apps so you can utilize

7906
02:42:31,309 --> 02:42:31,319
building mobile apps so you can utilize
 

7907
02:42:31,319 --> 02:42:33,230
building mobile apps so you can utilize
the.net framework it's very high

7908
02:42:33,230 --> 02:42:33,240
the.net framework it's very high
 

7909
02:42:33,240 --> 02:42:36,410
the.net framework it's very high
performance cross-platform as you can

7910
02:42:36,410 --> 02:42:36,420
performance cross-platform as you can
 

7911
02:42:36,420 --> 02:42:37,910
performance cross-platform as you can
see there's quite a bit that you can do

7912
02:42:37,910 --> 02:42:37,920
see there's quite a bit that you can do
 

7913
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:41,270
see there's quite a bit that you can do
with c-sharp from Blazer to xamarin from

7914
02:42:41,270 --> 02:42:41,280
with c-sharp from Blazer to xamarin from
 

7915
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:44,450
with c-sharp from Blazer to xamarin from
web to desktop c-sharp is something that

7916
02:42:44,450 --> 02:42:44,460
web to desktop c-sharp is something that
 

7917
02:42:44,460 --> 02:42:47,330
web to desktop c-sharp is something that
I've dabbled with but I want to get more

7918
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:47,340
I've dabbled with but I want to get more
 

7919
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:49,969
I've dabbled with but I want to get more
serious with it in the next in the next

7920
02:42:49,969 --> 02:42:49,979
serious with it in the next in the next
 

7921
02:42:49,979 --> 02:42:52,790
serious with it in the next in the next
year or so so that's one of my plans I

7922
02:42:52,790 --> 02:42:52,800
year or so so that's one of my plans I
 

7923
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:54,530
year or so so that's one of my plans I
really like C sharp I've used it for

7924
02:42:54,530 --> 02:42:54,540
really like C sharp I've used it for
 

7925
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:56,929
really like C sharp I've used it for
some small Windows utilities but never

7926
02:42:56,929 --> 02:42:56,939
some small Windows utilities but never
 

7927
02:42:56,939 --> 02:43:00,050
some small Windows utilities but never
really used it for for web development

7928
02:43:00,050 --> 02:43:00,060
really used it for for web development
 

7929
02:43:00,060 --> 02:43:01,849
really used it for for web development
so there's also a framework called

7930
02:43:01,849 --> 02:43:01,859
so there's also a framework called
 

7931
02:43:01,859 --> 02:43:03,650
so there's also a framework called
native script I don't have it on here

7932
02:43:03,650 --> 02:43:03,660
native script I don't have it on here
 

7933
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:05,450

previously known as node webkit and it's
 

8047
02:45:32,340 --> 02:45:34,309
previously known as node webkit and it's
similar to electron it's just not as

02:45:34,309 --> 02:45:34,319
similar to electron it's just not as
 

8049
02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:36,770

02:45:39,650 --> 02:45:39,660
you create native Windows Mac OS and
 

8053
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:43,429

Linux applications I do have a tutorial

8054
02:45:43,429 --> 02:45:43,439
Linux applications I do have a tutorial
 

8055
02:45:43,439 --> 02:45:47,210
Linux applications I do have a tutorial
on nwjs as well as electron I actually

8056
02:45:47,210 --> 02:45:47,220
on nwjs as well as electron I actually
 

8057
02:45:47,220 --> 02:45:49,550
on nwjs as well as electron I actually
have a full udemy course on electron but

8058
02:45:49,550 --> 02:45:49,560
have a full udemy course on electron but
 

8059
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:51,710
have a full udemy course on electron but
it is quite out of date that's why I

8060
02:45:51,710 --> 02:45:51,720
it is quite out of date that's why I
 

8061
02:45:51,720 --> 02:45:53,690
it is quite out of date that's why I
didn't move it to my platform

8062
02:45:53,690 --> 02:45:53,700
didn't move it to my platform
 

8063
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:55,849
didn't move it to my platform
all right so with python you have a

8064
02:45:55,849 --> 02:45:55,859
all right so with python you have a
 

8065
02:45:55,859 --> 02:45:57,170
all right so with python you have a
bunch of different Frameworks you can

8066
02:45:57,170 --> 02:45:57,180
bunch of different Frameworks you can
 

8067
02:45:57,180 --> 02:45:59,750
bunch of different Frameworks you can
use to create GUI apps tkinter is one of

8068
02:45:59,750 --> 02:45:59,760
use to create GUI apps tkinter is one of
 

8069
02:45:59,760 --> 02:46:02,270
use to create GUI apps tkinter is one of
them that's pretty easy to use I believe

8070
02:46:02,270 --> 02:46:02,280
them that's pretty easy to use I believe
 

8071
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:05,389
them that's pretty easy to use I believe
I have a tutorial on tkinter and then of

8072
02:46:05,389 --> 02:46:05,399
I have a tutorial on tkinter and then of
 

8073
02:46:05,399 --> 02:46:07,130
I have a tutorial on tkinter and then of
course you have you can build native

8074
02:46:07,130 --> 02:46:07,140
course you have you can build native
 

8075
02:46:07,140 --> 02:46:09,110
course you have you can build native
apps with languages like c-sharp and

8076
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:09,120
apps with languages like c-sharp and
 

8077
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:11,690
apps with languages like c-sharp and
Java but I think that that goes beyond

8078
02:46:11,690 --> 02:46:11,700
Java but I think that that goes beyond
 

8079
02:46:11,700 --> 02:46:14,210
Java but I think that that goes beyond
web development so that's why I'm not

8080
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:14,220
web development so that's why I'm not
 

8081
02:46:14,220 --> 02:46:16,550
web development so that's why I'm not
really going to talk about that much

8082
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:16,560
really going to talk about that much
 

8083
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:19,190
really going to talk about that much
all right so next we have webassembly or

8084
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:19,200
all right so next we have webassembly or
 

8085
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:21,050
all right so next we have webassembly or
wasm which I've mentioned a few times

8086
02:46:21,050 --> 02:46:21,060
wasm which I've mentioned a few times
 

8087
02:46:21,060 --> 02:46:23,570
wasm which I've mentioned a few times
already so this is a binary instruction

8088
02:46:23,570 --> 02:46:23,580

02:49:46,190 --> 02:49:46,200
around complaining about it isn't it's
 

8245
02:49:46,200 --> 02:49:48,349
around complaining about it isn't it's
not going to do you any good right now

8246
02:49:48,349 --> 02:49:48,359
not going to do you any good right now
 

8247
02:49:48,359 --> 02:49:50,570
not going to do you any good right now
you can use these tools to really help

8248
02:49:50,570 --> 02:49:50,580
you can use these tools to really help
 

8249
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:53,030
you can use these tools to really help
you in in coding and in your everyday

8250
02:49:53,030 --> 02:49:53,040
you in in coding and in your everyday
 

8251
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:56,870
you in in coding and in your everyday
life I mean I use chat GPT not only for

8252
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:56,880
life I mean I use chat GPT not only for
 

8253
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:59,570
life I mean I use chat GPT not only for
coding and solving issues there but also

8254
02:49:59,570 --> 02:49:59,580
coding and solving issues there but also
 

8255
02:49:59,580 --> 02:50:02,389
coding and solving issues there but also
just everyday issues if I need to fix my

8256
02:50:02,389 --> 02:50:02,399
just everyday issues if I need to fix my
 

8257
02:50:02,399 --> 02:50:05,570
just everyday issues if I need to fix my
my uh I actually used it to to help me

8258
02:50:05,570 --> 02:50:05,580
my uh I actually used it to to help me
 

8259
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:07,670
my uh I actually used it to to help me
diagnose an issue with my water boiler

8260
02:50:07,670 --> 02:50:07,680
diagnose an issue with my water boiler
 

8261
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:09,950
diagnose an issue with my water boiler
so I mean you can use it for anything

8262
02:50:09,950 --> 02:50:09,960
so I mean you can use it for anything
 

8263
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:13,490
so I mean you can use it for anything
so this stuff is far from perfect but

8264
02:50:13,490 --> 02:50:13,500
so this stuff is far from perfect but
 

8265
02:50:13,500 --> 02:50:15,410
so this stuff is far from perfect but
this is the first year where I can

8266
02:50:15,410 --> 02:50:15,420
this is the first year where I can
 

8267
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:19,429
this is the first year where I can
really see the potential of AI now I've

8268
02:50:19,429 --> 02:50:19,439
really see the potential of AI now I've
 

8269
02:50:19,439 --> 02:50:21,590
really see the potential of AI now I've
been talking about using AI for

8270
02:50:21,590 --> 02:50:21,600
been talking about using AI for
 

8271
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:24,290
been talking about using AI for
development but you can also create Ai

8272
02:50:24,290 --> 02:50:24,300
development but you can also create Ai
 

8273
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:26,389
development but you can also create Ai
and machine learning tools if that's

8274
02:50:26,389 --> 02:50:26,399
and machine learning tools if that's
 

8275
02:50:26,399 --> 02:50:28,250
and machine learning tools if that's
something you're interested in I would

8276
02:50:28,250 --> 02:50:28,260
something you're interested in I would
 

8277
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:30,469
something you're interested in I would
suggest that you get into Python and

8278
02:50:30,469 --> 02:50:30,479
suggest that you get into Python and
 

8279
02:50:30,479 --> 02:50:34,130
suggest that you get into Python and
things like tensorflow Keras H2O there's

8280
02:50:34,130 --> 02:50:34,140
things like tensorflow Keras H2O there's
 

8281
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:36,590
things like tensorflow Keras H2O there's
so many different python tools out there

8282
02:50:36,590 --> 02:50:36,600
so many different python tools out there
 

8283
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:38,270
so many different python tools out there
that you can use for machine learning

8284
02:50:38,270 --> 02:50:38,280
that you can use for machine learning
 

8285
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:41,330
that you can use for machine learning
but I would say that that that area of

8286
02:50:41,330 --> 02:50:41,340
but I would say that that that area of
 

8287
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:43,969
but I would say that that that area of
programming is beyond web development

8288
02:50:43,969 --> 02:50:43,979
programming is beyond web development
 

8289
02:50:43,979 --> 02:50:47,090
programming is beyond web development
now let's talk a little bit about web3

8290
02:50:47,090 --> 02:50:47,100
now let's talk a little bit about web3
 

8291
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:50,450
now let's talk a little bit about web3
so I think that last year I think web3

8292
02:50:50,450 --> 02:50:50,460
so I think that last year I think web3
 

8293
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:53,450
so I think that last year I think web3
was over hyped just to the max I don't

8294
02:50:53,450 --> 02:50:53,460
was over hyped just to the max I don't
 

8295
02:50:53,460 --> 02:50:55,849
was over hyped just to the max I don't
think I've ever seen anything so over

8296
02:50:55,849 --> 02:50:55,859
think I've ever seen anything so over
 

8297
02:50:55,859 --> 02:50:58,010
think I've ever seen anything so over
hyped you know there there's definitely

8298
02:50:58,010 --> 02:50:58,020
hyped you know there there's definitely
 

8299
02:50:58,020 --> 02:51:00,530
hyped you know there there's definitely
potential in web3 and I think it's a big

8300
02:51:00,530 --> 02:51:00,540
potential in web3 and I think it's a big
 

8301
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:01,969
potential in web3 and I think it's a big
part of our future but people were

8302
02:51:01,969 --> 02:51:01,979
part of our future but people were
 

8303
02:51:01,979 --> 02:51:03,889
part of our future but people were
acting like Web 2.0 was going to

8304
02:51:03,889 --> 02:51:03,899
acting like Web 2.0 was going to
 

8305
02:51:03,899 --> 02:51:06,349
acting like Web 2.0 was going to
disappear overnight and it was just pure

8306
02:51:06,349 --> 02:51:06,359
disappear overnight and it was just pure
 

8307
02:51:06,359 --> 02:51:08,750
disappear overnight and it was just pure
comedy just like webassembly it was

8308
02:51:08,750 --> 02:51:08,760
comedy just like webassembly it was
 

8309
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:09,710
comedy just like webassembly it was
going to kill was going to kill

8310
02:51:09,710 --> 02:51:09,720
going to kill was going to kill
 

8311
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:11,330
going to kill was going to kill
JavaScript Dino was going to kill

8312
02:51:11,330 --> 02:51:11,340
JavaScript Dino was going to kill
 

8313
02:51:11,340 --> 02:51:13,790
JavaScript Dino was going to kill
node.js you'd think people would learn

8314
02:51:13,790 --> 02:51:13,800
node.js you'd think people would learn
 

8315
02:51:13,800 --> 02:51:15,950
node.js you'd think people would learn
by now that things roll out much slower

8316
02:51:15,950 --> 02:51:15,960
by now that things roll out much slower
 

8317
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:17,870
by now that things roll out much slower
in reality than they do in people's

8318
02:51:17,870 --> 02:51:17,880
in reality than they do in people's
 

8319
02:51:17,880 --> 02:51:20,450
in reality than they do in people's
heads on social media now with that said

8320
02:51:20,450 --> 02:51:20,460
heads on social media now with that said
 

8321
02:51:20,460 --> 02:51:23,630
heads on social media now with that said
I think that like I said web3 is going

8322
02:51:23,630 --> 02:51:23,640
I think that like I said web3 is going
 

8323
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:25,490
I think that like I said web3 is going
to be a big part of our future and I

8324
02:51:25,490 --> 02:51:25,500
to be a big part of our future and I
 

8325
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:27,830
to be a big part of our future and I
think learning blockchain development at

8326
02:51:27,830 --> 02:51:27,840
think learning blockchain development at
 

8327
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:29,990
think learning blockchain development at
this point can be really valuable you

8328
02:51:29,990 --> 02:51:30,000
this point can be really valuable you
 

8329
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,870
this point can be really valuable you
get a jump on it now so blockchain is a

8330
02:51:32,870 --> 02:51:32,880
get a jump on it now so blockchain is a
 

8331
02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:35,150
get a jump on it now so blockchain is a
distributed database that's used to

8332
02:51:35,150 --> 02:51:35,160
distributed database that's used to
 

8333
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:38,290
distributed database that's used to
record transactions in a securely and

8334
02:51:38,290 --> 02:51:38,300
record transactions in a securely and
 

8335
02:51:38,300 --> 02:51:42,290
record transactions in a securely and
transparent way so it can be used to

8336
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:42,300
transparent way so it can be used to
 

8337
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:45,410
transparent way so it can be used to
create decentralized applications or

8338
02:51:45,410 --> 02:51:45,420
create decentralized applications or
 

8339
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:47,210
create decentralized applications or
d-apps or dapps however you want to

8340
02:51:47,210 --> 02:51:47,220
d-apps or dapps however you want to
 

8341
02:51:47,220 --> 02:51:49,190
d-apps or dapps however you want to
pronounce it and these are applications

8342
02:51:49,190 --> 02:51:49,200
pronounce it and these are applications
 

8343
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:51,290
pronounce it and these are applications
that are more secure and transparent

8344
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:51,300
that are more secure and transparent
 

8345
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:53,750
that are more secure and transparent
than regular traditional web

8346
02:51:53,750 --> 02:51:53,760
than regular traditional web
 

8347
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:55,130
than regular traditional web
applications

8348
02:51:55,130 --> 02:51:55,140
applications
 

8349
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:58,190
applications
so smart contracts are self-executing

8350
02:51:58,190 --> 02:51:58,200
so smart contracts are self-executing
 

8351
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:01,490
so smart contracts are self-executing
contracts with the terms of of an

8352
02:52:01,490 --> 02:52:01,500
contracts with the terms of of an
 

8353
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:04,130
contracts with the terms of of an
agreement between a buyer and seller and

8354
02:52:04,130 --> 02:52:04,140
agreement between a buyer and seller and
 

8355
02:52:04,140 --> 02:52:06,110
agreement between a buyer and seller and
they're directly written to lines of

8356
02:52:06,110 --> 02:52:06,120
they're directly written to lines of
 

8357
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:09,290
they're directly written to lines of
code so they can be used to automate

8358
02:52:09,290 --> 02:52:09,300
code so they can be used to automate
 

8359
02:52:09,300 --> 02:52:12,469
code so they can be used to automate
complex transactions and reduce the need

8360
02:52:12,469 --> 02:52:12,479
complex transactions and reduce the need
 

8361
02:52:12,479 --> 02:52:15,590
complex transactions and reduce the need
for intermediaries and I think getting

8362
02:52:15,590 --> 02:52:15,600
for intermediaries and I think getting
 

8363
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:18,230
for intermediaries and I think getting
into solidity which is a programming

8364
02:52:18,230 --> 02:52:18,240
into solidity which is a programming
 

8365
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:20,450
into solidity which is a programming
language used to create smart contracts

8366
02:52:20,450 --> 02:52:20,460
language used to create smart contracts
 

8367
02:52:20,460 --> 02:52:23,330
language used to create smart contracts
can be very beneficial again especially

8368
02:52:23,330 --> 02:52:23,340
can be very beneficial again especially
 

8369
02:52:23,340 --> 02:52:25,309
can be very beneficial again especially
where this stuff is so new it's good to

8370
02:52:25,309 --> 02:52:25,319
where this stuff is so new it's good to
 

8371
02:52:25,319 --> 02:52:28,070
where this stuff is so new it's good to
get a jump on it so cryptocurrencies

8372
02:52:28,070 --> 02:52:28,080
get a jump on it so cryptocurrencies
 

8373
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:31,490
get a jump on it so cryptocurrencies
such as Bitcoin and ethereum can be used

8374
02:52:31,490 --> 02:52:31,500
such as Bitcoin and ethereum can be used
 

8375
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:34,790
such as Bitcoin and ethereum can be used
in in web3 applications to facilitate

8376
02:52:34,790 --> 02:52:34,800
in in web3 applications to facilitate
 

8377
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:37,670
in in web3 applications to facilitate
transactions web 3 identity Solutions

8378
02:52:37,670 --> 02:52:37,680
transactions web 3 identity Solutions
 

8379
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:40,490
transactions web 3 identity Solutions
such as viewport provide users with more

8380
02:52:40,490 --> 02:52:40,500
such as viewport provide users with more
 

8381
02:52:40,500 --> 02:52:43,190
such as viewport provide users with more
control over their personal data and it

8382
02:52:43,190 --> 02:52:43,200
control over their personal data and it
 

8383
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:46,090
control over their personal data and it
enables them to securely interact with

8384
02:52:46,090 --> 02:52:46,100
enables them to securely interact with
 

8385
02:52:46,100 --> 02:52:49,370
enables them to securely interact with
decentralized apps so yeah I think that

8386
02:52:49,370 --> 02:52:49,380
decentralized apps so yeah I think that
 

8387
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:51,710
decentralized apps so yeah I think that
getting into web3 is a good idea but

8388
02:52:51,710 --> 02:52:51,720
getting into web3 is a good idea but
 

8389
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:53,330
getting into web3 is a good idea but
it's not something that you're going to

8390
02:52:53,330 --> 02:52:53,340
it's not something that you're going to
 

8391
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:55,730
it's not something that you're going to
go and get a job with right now at least

8392
02:52:55,730 --> 02:52:55,740
go and get a job with right now at least
 

8393
02:52:55,740 --> 02:52:58,010
go and get a job with right now at least
as far as I know

8394
02:52:58,010 --> 02:52:58,020
as far as I know
 

8395
02:52:58,020 --> 02:53:00,830
as far as I know
all right so congratulations if you sat

8396
02:53:00,830 --> 02:53:00,840
all right so congratulations if you sat
 

8397
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:02,870
all right so congratulations if you sat
through all that I commend you because

8398
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:02,880
